"""Product catalogue DTH (litlfred/dth-pc): elements and views for smart-ra.

Source: WHO, Digital transformation handbook for health product catalogue,
2025 (ISBN 9789240116191), L1 entry who-iris/library/9789240116191-eng.
Workplan: litlfred/dth-pc#2, section 2a and PC-3.

Only what the handbook states is modelled. Element names are the KG concepts
of dth-pc's glossary (glossary/dth-pc.glossary.json), Capitalized. Where a new
element may be the same thing as an element 0.2.0 already has, it carries
`candidateMatch` naming it, for the owner to decide. Medical devices are out
of the handbook's scope (owner, 2026-10-31, Q4); the views say so.

Supply chain partners, warehouse and regulator roles and the supply chain
capabilities are dth-sc's or 0.2.0's, reused by id, never redefined.
