Business Services Layer  ·  Health System Performance and Analytics  3

TERMINOLOGY 
AND SCOPE 
The Health Management Information System (HMIS) is also commonly referred to as 
a Routine Health Information System (RHIS). In the DPI-H reference architecture the 
HMIS sits in the business services layer; it is not a foundational component but a 
shared operational service that depends on foundational components — particularly 
the Lifelong Health Record (LHR), the Core Registries for Health, and the 
Terminology Service — to function. Analytics capabilities are treated as integral to 
the HMIS, consistent wit h the architecture's principle that the HMIS is the primary 
vehicle for deriving population -level and programme-level insight from data already 
captured through shared infrastructure. 
 5 
1  WHAT IT IS 
 6 
The Health Management Information System is a governed, sharedapplication component responsible for 7 
the systematic collection, aggregation, analysis, and dissemination of population -level and facility -level 8 
health data to support routine monitoring, programme performance measurement, strategic planning, 9 
health services commissioning, and public health decision -making. It consolidates data from the Lifelong 10 
Health Record (LHR), clinical systems, public health surveillance platforms, logistics systems, community 11 
health programmes, and other sources, transforming person -level and facility -level data into health 12 
indicators, dashboards, and reports that give health system managers, policymakers, and other relevant 13 
stakeholders the information they need to assess health system performance, identify trends and gaps, and 14 
guide resource allocation. 15 
Operating as shared infrastructure rather than a programme-specific tool, the HMIS serves multiple health 16 
domains simultaneously. Its defining architectural characteristic in the DPI -H ecosystem is that it is 17 
designed to derive aggregate information from data already captured at the point of care and held in shared 18 
infrastructure, rather than to collect data independently through parallel reporting mechanisms. This shift 19 
— from a system that extracts information from health workers to one that derives information from data 20 
that already exists — is what allows the HMIS to simultaneously reduce reporting burden, improve data 21 
quality, and deliver more timely and comprehensive information than traditional approaches have been able 22 
to provide. 23 
Analytics capabilities are integral to the HMIS rather than constituting a separate component. The distinction 24 
between data collection and aggregation on one hand, and analysis and visualisation on the other, is a 25 
functional distinction within the HMIS — both are capabilities of the same component, not separate systems. 26 
Both serve the same purpose — turning health data into health information — and both depend on the 27 
same foundational data infrastructure. The DPI -H reference architecture does not prescribe a single 28 
implementation model; the HMIS may be implemented as a unified platform or as a set of interoperable 29 
services, provided the functional outcomes described here are achieved. 30 
 31 
2  WHY IT MATTERS FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES 
 32 
Health systems generate substantial volumes of data through the daily delivery of care — patient 33 
encounters, diagnoses, treatments, laboratory results, immunisations, referrals, and community health 34 
interactions. In the majority of health systems, this data does not flow naturally into the information that 35 
   
 
211 
health system managers and policymakers need to make decisions. Health workers are instead required 36 
to manually compile and submit reports, extracting from registers and patient records information that was 37 
already captured at the point of care, reformatting it for each programme that requests it, and submitting it 38 
through parallel channels that operate independently. The result is a system in which the people who deliver 39 
care spend significant time producing information for those who manage it, while the information produced 40 
is frequently incomplete, delayed, and difficult to compare across facilities, programmes, or time. 41 
Without a governed, shared health management information capability, every health programme 42 
establishes its own data collection, aggregation, and reporting infrastructure. The consequence is a 43 
proliferation of parallel reporting systems, each placing its own demands on facilities and health workers, 44 
each producing data in formats that resist integration, and each requiring separate maintenance and 45 
technical support. The administrative burden of parallel reporting has been consistently identified in the 46 
literature as one of the most significant barriers to data quality, health worker satisfaction, and the 47 
productive use of health information at every level of the system. 48 
When a governed HMIS is in place, several outcomes become achievable.  49 
• The reporting burden on the health workforce is reduced because aggregate health information is 50 
derived from data already captured at the point of care through shared infrastructure.  51 
• Health system managers and policymakers receive timely, accurate, and comparable indicators 52 
that reflect the current state of the health system, consistent across facilities and administrative 53 
levels, and reliably comparable over time and across geographies.  54 
• Cross-programme visibility allows health authorities to understand performance across disease 55 
areas, population groups, and levels of care simultaneously.  56 
• Evidence-based resource allocation becomes possible when ministries of health and finance have 57 
access to current, credible performance data.  58 
• Population-level analytical capabilities — the ability to detect trends, identify gaps, and monitor 59 
programme outcomes — are available across the health system without requiring each programme 60 
to build and maintain its own analytical infrastructure. 61 
 62 
3  CORE ATTRIBUTES 
 63 
– Data collection and ingestion. Reception of health data through multiple channels, including 64 
direct facility-based and community-based reporting, automated ingestion from the LHR and other 65 
DPI-H components, and bulk import of structured datasets. Data derivation from shared 66 
infrastructure is prioritised over parallel data collection from health workers wherever possible. 67 
– Indicator definition and management. Maintenance of a configurable, versioned registry of 68 
health indicators — including their definitions, numerators, denominators, disaggregation 69 
dimensions, data sources, and calculation logic — aligned to national health strategies and 70 
international reporting frameworks, with a governed change management process that preserves 71 
comparability over time. 72 
– Data aggregation and transformation. Aggregation of individual-level or facility-level data into 73 
summary indicators at configurable levels of the administrative and health system hierarchy, 74 
applying defined aggregation rules, periodicity, and data quality checks, enabling information to be 75 
available at the level of granularity required by different users without separate data collection for 76 
each level. 77 
– Data quality assurance. Built-in validation rules, completeness checks, consistency checks, and 78 
outlier detection that flag and support the resolution of data quality issues at the point of entry and 79 
during aggregation, with structured feedback to contributing facilities and programmes so that 80 
issues identified centrally can be resolved at source. 81 
– Analysis and visualisation. Analytical tools and configurable dashboards enabling users to 82 
explore data, generate charts and maps, perform trend analysis, compare performance across 83 
   
 
212 
organisational units, and conduct ad hoc queries, making health information accessible and 84 
actionable for users at all levels of the health system. 85 
– Reporting and dissemination. Generation and distribution of standard and custom reports 86 
aligned to national reporting requirements, donor frameworks, and international obligations, in both 87 
human-readable and machine-readable formats, supporting timely flow of health information to all 88 
stakeholders who depend on it for planning, accountability, and oversight. 89 
– Geographic information integration. Integration of geographic data, linked to the Health Facility 90 
Registry, to support spatial analysis, thematic mapping, and location-based comparison of health 91 
indicators across administrative and service delivery boundaries. 92 
– Programme and cohort tracking. Identification and tracking of defined patient or population 93 
cohorts over time, enabling programme-specific performance monitoring and outcome evaluation 94 
across disease areas without requiring each programme to maintain its own data collection 95 
infrastructure. 96 
– De-identification and privacy protection. Systematic de-identification of data presented for 97 
aggregate analysis, reporting, and secondary use, in accordance with national data protection 98 
regulations, ensuring that population-level insight is delivered without exposing individual health 99 
information. 100 
– Secondary use and research support. Provision of mechanisms for making de-identified, 101 
aggregate, or anonymised datasets available for approved secondary uses — including 102 
operational research, health system evaluation, and academic study — subject to appropriate 103 
governance and ethical review. 104 
– Interoperability and data exchange. Standardised exchange of data with other DPI-H 105 
components — including the Lifelong Health Record, the Public Health Surveillance Platform, the 106 
Terminology Service, and logistics systems — using agreed data standards and integration 107 
profiles. 108 
 109 
4  HOW IT CONNECTS 
 110 
The HMIS occupies a distinctive position in the DPI -H architecture: it is a major consumer of data from 111 
foundational DPI-H components and a primary producer of information for health system management and 112 
policy.  113 
The Lifelong Health Record  is the primary source of person -level clinical data from which the HMIS 114 
derives aggregate health indicators. Rather than requiring facilities and health workers to submit the same 115 
data through parallel reporting channels, the HMIS draws on data already captured at the point of care and 116 
held in the LHR, de -identifying and aggregating it in accordance with defined indicator logic. This 117 
relationship is central to the architecture's principle of capturing data once and using it many times, and is 118 
what distinguishes the HMIS in a DPI-H ecosystem from traditional routine health information systems. 119 
The Client Registry provides the person identity foundation that enables the HMIS to correctly attribute 120 
clinical data to individuals before aggregation, supporting cohort identification, programme enrolment 121 
tracking, and the accurate calculation of population denominators for health indicators. The HMIS does not 122 
hold personal identifiers in its aggregate outputs but depends on the Client Registry to ensure that the 123 
person-level data it draws from is correctly linked before de-identification occurs. 124 
The Health Facility Registry  provides authoritative references for the facilities from which health data 125 
originates, enabling the HMIS to aggregate indicators at facility, district, regional, and national levels of the 126 
administrative hierarchy. Facility attributes including location, type, ownership, and service delivery capacity 127 
support geographic analysis, thematic mapping, and the comparison of indicators across facility categories. 128 
The Terminology Service ensures that clinical data drawn from the LHR and other source systems carries 129 
consistent coded meaning when ingested by the HMIS. Aggregate indicators depend on the semantic 130 
consistency of the underlying data; without governed terminology, the same clinical concept recorded with 131 
different codes in different systems would be aggregated incorrectly or incompletely. 132 
   
 
213 
The Health Workforce Registry provides data on workforce distribution, deployment, and composition of 133 
health worker types and cadres, that the HMIS uses to produce workforce -related health indicators, 134 
including staffing ratios, health worker density, and deployment gaps across administrative units. These 135 
indicators feed into national health workforce planning and international reporting frameworks including the 136 
WHO National Health Workforce Accounts. 137 
The HMIS and the Public Health Surveillance Platform (PHSP)  are complementary but distinct. The 138 
HMIS aggregates routine health indicators from facility-level reporting and the LHR to support programme 139 
monitoring and strategic planning. The PHSP focuses on the detection, investigation, and response to 140 
public health threats through event -based and case -level surveillance. The two exchange data 141 
bidirectionally: the HMIS provides aggregate indicators that inform surveillance baselines and trend 142 
analysis, while the surveillance platform contributes case-level and outbreak data that enriches the HMIS's 143 
picture of health system performance during public health events. Where boundaries between the two are 144 
unclear, countries should define them through their national health information architecture rather than 145 
relying on a universal demarcation. 146 
The Computable Decision Support Engine draws on aggregate performance data and population -level 147 
indicators from the HMIS to inform the updating and validation of clinical rules and guidelines. Population -148 
level patterns detected through the HMIS — such as shifts in disease burden, treatment outcomes, or 149 
screening coverage — can trigger the review and refinement of decision support logic. The relationship is 150 
primarily unidirectional, with the HMIS informing knowledge governance processes that the CDSE 151 
operationalises at the point of care. 152 
The Logical Information Model Repository  (LIMR) provides the structural definitions that govern how 153 
data ingested by the HMIS is organised and interpreted. Consistent data structures across contributing 154 
systems are a prerequisite for reliable indicator aggregation; the LIMR ensures that the data the HMIS 155 
receives conforms to the logical models against which its indicator calculations are defined, and that 156 
changes to those models are managed in a coordinated way rather than introducing silent inconsistencies 157 
into aggregate outputs. 158 
 159 
5  FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
 160 
Requirements are grouped by business process and draw on the OpenHIE HMIS specification (HMISF -1 161 
to HMISF-7; HMISWF-1) and the broader DPI -H architectural context. The DPI -H reference architecture 162 
extends OpenHIE significantly: the OpenHIE HMIS specification describes only one Required requirement 163 
(HMISF-1) and six Recommended. The DPI -H extensions reflect the broader role of the HMIS as shared 164 
infrastructure in a DPI -H ecosystem, where its integration with the LHR, its analytics capabilities, its de -165 
identification obligations, and its secondary use governance are architecturally material. Where a 166 
requirement extends beyond OpenHIE, this is noted. 167

 169 
Note: Requirements align with and extend the OpenHIE HMIS specification (https://guides.ohie.org/arch-170 
spec/openhie-component-specifications-1/openhie-health-management-information-system-hmis). The 171 
DPI-H reference architecture extends OpenHIE in five principal respects: (1) LHR derivation is introduced 172 
as the preferred data sourcing approach; (2) indicator versioning and change management are made 173 
explicit Required requirements; (3) de-identification is made an explicit Required requirement; (4) 174 
analytics capabilities are integrated into the HMIS rather than treated as a separate component; and (5) 175 
several OpenHIE Recommended requirements are elevated to Required to reflect the HMIS's role as 176 
shared health information infrastructure. The OpenHIE HMIS workflow requirement HMISWF-1 (Validate 177 
and Save Aggregate Data) is the primary workflow underpinning requirements 1–4 and 7–8. 178 
GOVERNANCE 
Governance of the HMIS follows the cross -cutting governance framework in Section 
3.4 of the guidance document. Component-specific considerations include:  
 
(1) Institutional ownership: Stewardship of the HMIS should be vested in a health 
authority with a mandate that spans all health programmes rather than being confined 
to any single disease area or vertical initiative. Independence from individual 
programme interests is essential beca use the HMIS serves the health system as a 
whole and measures the performance of those very programmes. Ownership should 
not be delegated to a vendor, donor-funded project, or programme-specific entity.  
(2) Indicator governance:  The definition, calculation, and management of health 
indicators is a governance function, not merely a technical one. Countries should 
establish a formal indicator governance process through which new indicators are 
proposed, reviewed for clinical and ep idemiological validity, aligned to reporting 
frameworks, and approved. Changes to indicator definitions should be managed 
through a versioned process that preserves comparability over time and notifies 
stakeholders.  
(3) Data quality accountability: Clear accountability for data quality at every level of 
the reporting hierarchy — from the contributing facility to the national publishing 
authority — should be established, with feedback mechanisms through which quality 
issues identified during aggregation are communicated back and resolved.  
(4) Multi-stakeholder governance: The HMIS serves multiple health programmes 
simultaneously. Countries should establish a multi -stakeholder governance body 
including representatives from all major health programmes, ministry of finance, 
development partners, and civil society, with clear decision rights and accountability 
to the national health authority.  
(5) Financing: The HMIS is shared infrastructure that serves all health programmes 
simultaneously, and its financing should reflect that shared character. Countries 
should avoid models in which the HMIS is financed entirely through project -specific 
donor funding tied to  individual programme reporting requirements, as these create 
incentives that fragment the indicator portfolio and undermine institutional 
independence.
