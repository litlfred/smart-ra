Business Services Layer  ·  Health Financing 3

ARCHITECTURE 
PLACEMENT 
The Benefits Package Registry sits at the business services layer of the DPI -H 
reference architecture. It references and depends on core registries (Client, Health 
Facility, Product) but is more domain-specific and operationally dynamic than those 
foundational components. It is architecturally distinct from two adjacent components, 
which sit in the functional application layer: (1) the Contract and Benefits 
Management System, which manages the operational relationships between 
payers, providers, and beneficiaries; and (2) the Beneficiary Registry, which records 
which individuals are enrolled in which schemes. The Benefits Package Registry is 
the shared reference that both depend on. 
 5 
1  WHAT IT IS 
 6 
The Benefits Package Registry is the national authoritative record of all health benefit packages offered 7 
within a country's health financing ecosystem. It holds the definitive description of what each package 8 
covers, who defines it, who finances it, and under what conditions a person may be eligible for it — spanning 9 
government-funded entitlements, social health protection schemes, community-based programmes, donor-10 
supported benefits, disease -specific subsidies, private insurance schemes, and NGO -run schemes. Its 11 
defining purpose is to provide a shared, machine-readable reference against which any system in the health 12 
ecosystem can determine what a given benefit package contains, without needing to duplicate or 13 
independently maintain that definition. 14 
The registry is a metadata component in the precise architectural sense: it holds definitions, not 15 
transactions. It does not enrol beneficiaries, process claims, or manage payer -provider contracts. Those 16 
functions belong to operational systems that consume the registry as their reference source. What the 17 
registry provides is the stable, governed, agreed -upon description of what has been promised — the 18 
canonical answer to the question: what is covered, for whom, by whom, under what conditions, and to what 19 
limits — including which providers and facilities are accredited to deliver covered services, and which 20 
specific products are covered and under what conditions, including any restrictions on generic medicines 21 
substitution or emergency alternatives. 22 
In health financing, health coverage schemes refer to any organised arrangement through which a defined 23 
population is entitled to a defined set of health services or products, regardless of the financing mechanism 24 
or institutional form. This includes contributory and non -contributory health insurance schemes, 25 
government-funded entitlement programmes, employer -provided health benefits, donor -funded service 26 
delivery programmes, community -based health financing arrangements, and targeted service delivery 27 
models for specific population groups. What distinguishes a scheme from general health service provision 28 
is the existence of a defined benefit package — a governed specification of what is covered, for whom, and 29 
under what conditions. 30 
 31 
2  WHY IT MATTERS FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES 
 32 
Progress toward universal health coverage depends on knowing, with precision and consistency, what 33 
services people are entitled to receive. In most countries today, that knowledge is fragmented — held in 34 
separate documents, scheme-specific databases, donor agreements, and operational systems that do not 35 
   
 
200 
share a common reference. Some challenges faced in countries are that a provider is unable to reliably 36 
determine at the point of care what a patient is covered for and a Ministry of Health cannot assess coverage 37 
gaps or identify which populations are unprotected without manually reconciling information held across 38 
multiple institutions. The result is a system that formally promises coverage but cannot operationally deliver 39 
it with consistency or transparency. 40 
When a Benefits Package Registry is in place, a shared, authoritative definition of entitlements becomes 41 
available across the health system: 42 
• Claims systems can validate against an authoritative package definition rather than a local copy 43 
that may have drifted.  44 
• Eligibility for a specific individual and service combination can be consistently determined, 45 
regardless of which system or channel is querying.  46 
• Governments gain the visibility to identify populations not reached by any scheme, detect benefit 47 
overlaps, and make evidence-based decisions about package design and financing.  48 
• For beneficiaries, this transparency means that what they are entitled to is discoverable, checkable, 49 
and comparable to what they actually receive — a foundational condition for accountability in health 50 
financing. 51 
• Providers and pharmacies can access up-to-date information on covered services, medicines, and 52 
conditions at the point of care, supporting prescribing and treatment decisions that are consistent 53 
with what benefit packages include and what patients are entitled to receive. 54 
 55 
3  CORE  ATTRIBUTES 
 56 
– Benefit package catalogue management. Creation, maintenance, and publication of authoritative 57 
benefit package definitions, covering all scheme types within a country's financing ecosystem — 58 
insurance-based, government-funded, community-based, and donor-financed — without assuming 59 
any single financing model. 60 
– Benefit structure and coverage definition. Structured definition of what each package covers: 61 
included services, procedures, diagnostics, medicines, and devices; exclusions; co-payment and 62 
cost-sharing rules; utilisation caps; and annual limits — at a level of granularity sufficient to support 63 
claims validation and eligibility determination. 64 
– Eligibility criteria management. Definition and governance of the eligibility criteria associated 65 
with each benefit package, including demographic, socioeconomic, employment-status, disease-66 
specific, and geographic criteria, and support for referencing eligibility rules that sit in external 67 
systems (social protection registries, poverty databases) without replicating them. 68 
– Multi-scheme and multi-payer association. Management of the payer or funding source 69 
associated with each benefit package, supporting environments with multiple concurrent schemes 70 
operated by different institutions — public insurers, social health protection agencies, private 71 
insurers, and government programmes — within a single registry. 72 
– Facility and service empanelment linkage. Support for linking benefit packages to the facilities, 73 
service categories, and provider types through which covered services may be accessed, enabling 74 
the registry to inform referral and eligibility determination at point of care. 75 
– Coverage rules and limits management. Management of service-level coverage rules including 76 
coverage levels by facility tier, geographic availability, referral requirements, and any differential 77 
coverage conditions applied under specific schemes or population groups. 78 
– Package lifecycle and version management. Maintenance of full version history for benefit 79 
package definitions, with support for concurrent versions, defined lifecycle states, and backward-80 
compatible referencing so that claims submitted against prior package versions can be validated 81 
correctly. 82 
   
 
201 
– Cross-scheme visibility and gap analysis. Query capability enabling authorised users — 83 
Ministry of Health officials, health financing analysts, regulators — to view benefit coverage across 84 
all registered schemes, identify populations not covered by any package, and detect coverage 85 
overlaps or duplication across schemes. 86 
 87 
4  HOW IT CONNECTS 
 88 
The Benefits Package Registry occupies a central position in the health financing architecture by providing 89 
the reference data on which multiple systems and processes depend. Its relationships fall into four 90 
categories: the components it depends on, the components that consume it, the operational systems it is 91 
architecturally distinct from, and the cross-sectoral systems it interacts with. 92 
A. The registry depends on foundational DPI-H components for its anchor data.  93 
• The Client Registry provides the shared identity layer; the Benefits Package Registry does not 94 
replicate identity but records which schemes a person may be enrolled in as a cross-reference.  95 
• The Health Facility Registry provides the authoritative list of facilities; the registry references this to 96 
associate benefit packages with empanelled providers and to determine where covered services 97 
can be accessed.  98 
• The Product Registry provides the standardised catalogue of medicines and health commodities; 99 
benefit package definitions that include medicine coverage reference product identifiers from that 100 
registry rather than maintaining parallel lists.  101 
• The Terminology Service provides the standardised coding of services, procedures, and diagnoses 102 
that benefit definitions use to specify covered items unambiguously — an essential dependency if 103 
the registry is to support consistent claims validation across systems. 104 
B. The registry is consumed by every system that needs to determine what is covered or validate a claimed 105 
benefit. Eligibility verification services query the registry to determine whether a specific service is 106 
covered under a person's scheme. Claims management systems validate submitted claims against the 107 
benefit package definitions held in the registry, checking that claimed services, quantities, and amounts 108 
are within coverage rules. Analytics and reporting systems draw on the registry to produce population-109 
level coverage assessments, national health accounts analyses, and purchasing performance reports. 110 
Beneficiary-facing portals and health wallets reference the registry to show individuals what they are 111 
entitled to. 112 
C. Two adjacent operational components are architecturally distinct from the registry and should not be 113 
conflated with it.  114 
• The Contract and Benefits Management System manages the operational relationships between 115 
payers, providers, and beneficiaries — it handles enrolment transactions, payer-provider contracts, 116 
premium collection, and individual eligibility determination. It consumes the Benefits Package 117 
Registry as its reference source but manages dynamic, transactional data that does not belong in 118 
the registry. 119 
• The Beneficiary Registry records which individuals are enrolled in which schemes and under what 120 
conditions; it is a scheme -management tool that references the package definitions held in the 121 
Benefits Package Registry to resolve coverage for specific individuals. 122 
D. The registry also interacts with systems and registries outside the health sector. Eligibility for some 123 
benefit packages depends on social protection status, poverty classification, or employment data held 124 
in external registries. The reference architecture's orchestration model enables eligibility checking to 125 
reference these external sources without the health sector owning or duplicating that data. Government 126 
payment infrastructure (e -payment systems, treasury systems) and public financial management 127 
systems are further downstream dependencies that receive the financial flows triggered by eligibility 128 
and claims decisions that reference package definitions. 129 
 130

5  FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
 131 
These requirements are consistent with and extend the OpenHIE Finance and Insurance Service (FIS) 132 
specification58, particularly the Beneficiary Management process group (FISF-01 to FISF-05). They are also 133 
informed by the JLN health financing business process framework and the World Bank Playbook on Digital 134 
Social Protection Delivery Systems 59. The DPI -H reference architecture extends these sources to cover 135 
non-insurance financing schemes, the orchestration model for cross -sector eligibility, and the explicit 136 
governance of benefit package metadata as a shared national asset. 137 
Functional requirements are grouped by the business process they support. Where OpenHIE Finance and 138 
Insurance Service (FIS) process references exist, these are noted in the business process column (e.g., 139 
FISF-03). Requirements marked ‘Required’ are mandatory for conformance; those marked ‘Recommended’ 140 
are strongly advised and expected in well -functioning implementations but may be phased according to 141 
country maturity. 142

packages are generalised beyond insurance-specific definitions to cover all health financing mechanisms; 147 
eligibility criteria management explicitly accommodates cross -sector external rule referencing; and the 148 
registry is defined as a shared national metadata asset under formal governance, rather than a functional 149 
component of a specific claims or insurance management system. 150

206 
GOVERNANCE 
Governance of the Benefits Package Registry follows the cross -cutting governance 
framework set out in Section 3.4 of the guidance document. Component -specific 
considerations include:  
(1) The Benefits Package Registry has a uniquely complex multi -institutional 
governance context. Unlike registries with a single steward (such as the Health Facility 
Registry owned by the MoH), benefit package definitions may be authored by multiple 
institutions — the Ministry of Health, national health insurance agencies, private 
scheme operators, and donor-financed programme managers — each with legitimate 
authority over their own schemes. The governance framework should clearly define 
which institution has stewardship authority for each package type, and what approval 
is required before a package definition can be published or modified.  
(2) Because eligibility for some benefit packages depends on data held in external 
social protection systems, the governance framework should address cross -
institutional data referencing — including data sharing agreements, refresh 
schedules, and dispute resolution for cases where an external eligibility source returns 
inconsistent data.  
(3) The registry should be designed to support the central oversight principle: central 
visibility without central control. Ministries of Health and regulators require aggregate 
visibility across all schemes to support coverage analysis and policy; this do es not 
imply that they control the operational management of individual schemes.
