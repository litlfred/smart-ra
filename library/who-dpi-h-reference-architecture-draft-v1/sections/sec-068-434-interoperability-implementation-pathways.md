Several architectural pathways exist for implementing interoperability for DPI-H. The pathway a 370 
country takes depends on its existing governance context (including legislative or administrative 371 
requirements), the availability of foundational DPI for interoperability, system capability, and the 372 
legacy landscape. The architecture recommends prioritising the logical decoupling of core 373 
functions — such as clinical data exchange, health financing, and shared registries — during 374 
implementation. 375 
Anchoring interoperability on open standards and specifications allows diverse systems to be 376 
integrated without lock-in — as seen, for example, where a country’s point-of-care clinical 377 
application integration requirements are expressed against open profiles. The modular structure 378 
this logical decoupling enables allows countries to adopt capabilities incrementally, without 379 
redesigning the entire ecosystem. The physical implementation can then be centralised, 380 
distributed, or hybrid: 381

• Centralised models. National shared infrastructure orchestrates data exchange and 382 
provides stronger public governance, standards enforcement, security oversight, and 383 
accountability. 384 
• Federated models. Systems exchange data directly, rather than through a central hub, 385 
anchored on shared standards and shared reference data — common identifiers from 386 
the core registries and agreed terminology. This preserves institutional autonomy while 387 
maintaining interoperability. 388 
• Hybrid models. Centralised functions, such as master registries and policy 389 
enforcement, coexist with decentralised data exchange, aiming to balance national 390 
coordination with localised needs across specific use cases. 391 
Several countries with large populations have, for example, implemented a hybrid model in 392 
which health records are shared through a health information exchange component while health 393 
financing claims are orchestrated through a claims exchange component. This provides a 394 
centralised mechanism for sharing health records while addressing localised needs for 395 
orchestrating claims transactions, such as membership and benefits confirmation, pre-396 
authorisation, and claims settlement. 397
