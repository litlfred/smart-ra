The stable, conformance-bearing elements are the Application Service (capability) and the 1234 
Application Component (system in an actor role); the Application Interaction is the 1235 
descriptive connection between them, and where it is a transaction its specification may be 1236 
deferred to IHE. 1237

4. Implementing a National Digital 1 
Health Architecture  2 
 3 
The preceding chapters describe a reference architecture. This chapter addresses how 4 
countries move toward it: how to assess the starting point, sequence investment, specify the 5 
profiles that make the architecture implementable, verify conformance and progress, and put in 6 
place the people, skills, and financing that sustain it. It is written for the range of actors a 7 
national effort depends on — the ministries and agencies that govern it, the architects and 8 
modellers who design it, the implementers who build it, and the development partners who 9 
support it — and it is explicit, throughout, about who is accountable for each of these 10 
responsibilities. 11
