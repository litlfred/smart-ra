Core Registries for Health  ·  DPI-H Foundational Layer   226 
 227 
ARCHITECTURE 
PLACEMENT 
The Health Workforce Registry is a core DPI -H foundational component — the 
shared identity and credential anchor for health workers across the health 
ecosystem. It is architecturally distinct from two operational systems: the Human 
Resources Information Sy stem (HRIS), which manages employment transactions, 
payroll processing, leave management, and workforce scheduling; and the Learning 
Management System (LMS), which manages training delivery, course enrolment, 
and assessment. The Health Workforce Registry h olds the authoritative master 
record of who a health worker is and what they are qualified and licensed to do. The 
HRIS and LMS consume this registry as their reference source; neither replaces it. 
 228 
1  WHAT IT IS 
 229 
The Health Workforce Registry is the national authoritative record of identity, credential, and classification 230 
data for all health workers recognised as part of the national health workforce — including licensed or 231 
certified professionals employed in both public and private sectors and, where nationally defined and 232 
registered, community health workers and other cadres operating in informal or semi -formal capacities. It 233 
maintains a standardised, uniquely identified record for each health worker, providing the common 234 
reference point against which clinical, administrative, financing, and regulatory systems can consistently 235 
identify, verify, and classify the people delivering health services. 236 
The registry holds two interlocking categories of information: 237 
1. The first is identity: who the health worker is — their demographics, unique identifier, and may 238 
cross-reference to foundational identification systems.  239 
2. The second is credentials: what the health worker is qualified and authorised to do — their 240 
occupational classification, professional registration, licensing status, and qualifications.  241 
Together, these form the data foundation for a health system that can assure the quality and accountability 242 
of its workforce at scale. 243 
The WHO National Health Workforce Accounts (NHWA) handbook (Second Edition, 2023) defines 29 244 
indicators that underpin health workforce monitoring, planning, and policy — covering stock, flow, 245 
education, migration, and expenditure. The national health workforce registry is a key data source for 12 of 246 
these indicators, notably those measuring stock and flow – critical to workforce planning and equitable 247 
distribution. The Health Workforce Registry, as defined in the DPI -H reference architecture, provides the 248 
foundational data infrastructure from which these indicators can be derived. 249 
 250 
2  WHY IT MATTERS FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES 
 251 
Health systems deliver care through people. The quality, safety, and equity of that care depend on knowing 252 
who those people are, what they are qualified to do, and where they are deployed. Ministries of Health need 253 
to determine whether a health worker is legitimately registered, where workforce shortages are emerging, 254 
or whether payroll rolls include inactive or unqualified personnel. Without a reliable national registry, health 255 
worker data can be fragmented across professional councils, employer HR systems, facility registers, and 256 
paper-based records and these can sometimes be inconsistent, incomplete, and may not always be current.  257 
   
 
136 
Other considerations are that patients want to be assured that they are receiving care from practitioners 258 
whose registration status or licence can be verified at the point of service, health system managers want to 259 
know that fraud in payroll and insurance claims can be detected when provider identity can be confirmed, 260 
and ministries of health want to be able to make workforce planning decisions on reliable data, to address 261 
shortages and ensure distribution of the health workforce relative to population need. The WHO reports 262 
that the lack of sufficient health workers was consistently the most common cause of disruptions to essential 263 
health services, including during health emergencies like COVID -19 — a finding that depends on the kind 264 
of reliable workforce data that a functioning registry can provide (WHO NHWA handbook, Second Edition, 265 
2023). 266 
When a Health Workforce Registry is in place, systems that employ, pay, deploy, or regulate health workers 267 
can orient around a shared authoritative record, thus providing the enabling conditions for a health system 268 
that is both safe for patients and accountable in its use of public resources. 269 
 270 
3  CORE ATTRIBUTES 
 271 
– Health worker identity and master record management. Creation, maintenance, and lifecycle 272 
management of authoritative identity records for all health workers, covering the full scope of the 273 
WHO health worker classification framework — health professionals, health associate 274 
professionals, personal care workers, health management and support personnel, and other health 275 
service providers (WHO, 2010). 276 
– Unique health worker identifier assignment and management. Assignment of a nationally 277 
unique, non-intelligent identifier to each registered health worker, persistent across changes in 278 
name, employer, or administrative boundary, and cross-referenced to foundational identification 279 
systems where available. 280 
– Occupational classification and multi-scheme coding. Classification of health workers using 281 
the ISCO-08 based WHO health worker classification framework, with support for concurrent 282 
national occupational codes, enabling consistent workforce data aggregation for national reporting 283 
and NHWA indicator production. 284 
– Licensing and registration management. Storage and governance of professional registration 285 
and licensing data, including registration number, issuing licensing body, licence status (active, 286 
expired, suspended, revoked), and licence expiry date, with real-time or near-real-time updates 287 
from licensing authorities. 288 
– Qualification and credential management. Maintenance of each health worker's qualifications — 289 
degree, certificate, issuing institution, and date of completion — and continuing professional 290 
development (CPD) status where national frameworks require it, supporting credential recognition 291 
and workforce development tracking. 292 
– Deployment and facility affiliation management. Linkage of each health worker to their primary 293 
employer or facility and any secondary affiliations, cross-referenced to the Facility Registry, 294 
enabling workforce distribution analysis and payroll attribution by location. 295 
– Verification service. Provision of standards-based identity and credential verification services 296 
enabling any consuming system — clinical, financial, or regulatory — to confirm a health worker's 297 
registration status, licence validity, and occupational classification in real or near-real time. 298 
– Workforce analytics and NHWA reporting support. Support for the production of NHWA-aligned 299 
indicators on workforce stock, distribution, qualifications, and employment, enabling Ministries of 300 
Health to meet their national and international reporting obligations using registry data. 301 
 302 
4  HOW IT CONNECTS 
 303 
Relationship with other DPI-H components 304 
   
 
137 
The Health Workforce Registry is one of the Core Registries for Health within the DPI -H reference 305 
architecture. Its closest structural counterpart is the Client Registry with each providing a shared identity 306 
anchor — one for health service users, the other for health workers. Both follow similar patterns of unique 307 
identifier management, multi-identifier cross-referencing, and standards-based query APIs. 308 
The Health Facility Registry is the Health Workforce Registry's primary peer dependency. A health worker 309 
record without a facility affiliation has limited operational value; a facility record without linked workforce 310 
data cannot support staffing analysis. The two registries are designed to be jointly queried — through the 311 
IHE Mobile Care Services Discovery (mCSD) profile, which covers both health worker and facility data — 312 
to answer questions about workforce distribution, service availability, and facility capacity. 313 
The Terminology Service can host the standardised occupation codes, qualification categories, and 314 
specialisation taxonomies that give health worker classification data its semantic meaning. Without 315 
consistent coding anchored in a Terminology Service, it may prove difficult to reliably aggregate workforce 316 
data from different sources. The Logical Information Model Repository holds the canonical schema defining 317 
what attributes a health worker record should contain, their cardinalities, and their terminology bindings. 318 
 319 
Relationship with point of service and functional applications 320 
The Health Workforce Registry is consumed by a wide range of downstream systems. For example: 321 
• Clinical systems can verify prescribing authority, referral eligibility, and facility-level staffing at point 322 
of care.  323 
• Health coverage schemes and claims management systems can use the registry to confirm that a 324 
provider submitting a claim is legitimately registered and affiliated with the relevant facility.  325 
• Payroll and incentive payment systems can use it to validate worker eligibility before disbursement. 326 
• Health workforce planning and analytics systems can draw on it to produce supply-side workforce 327 
indicators.  328 
• Learning management systems can reference it to track CPD completion and update qualification 329 
records. 330 
 331 
Relationship with foundational identification systems 332 
The relationship with foundational identification systems mirrors that of the Client Registry. Where a national 333 
ID system exists, the Health Workforce Registry can store the foundational identifier as a cross -reference 334 
and may verify identity against it at registration. Where it does not, the registry would provide the health 335 
sector's own identity anchor. Professional regulatory councils and licensing bodies are primary upstream 336 
data providers, as they hold the authoritative source for registration and licensing data, and the governance 337 
framework should specify how data from these sources is incorporated and which takes precedence in 338 
cases of conflict. 339 
 340 
5  FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
 341 
Requirements are grouped by the business process they support. OpenHIE Health Worker Registry (HWR) 342 
workflow and functional requirement references (HWWF -1 to HWWF-4; HWRF-1 to HWRF-12) are noted 343 
where applicable. The DPI -H reference architecture extends the OpenHIE specification in the following 344 
respects: licensing and credential management are made explicit as distinct requirement groups; NHWA 345 
reporting alignment is introduced; verification service requirements are elevated; and facility affiliation 346 
management is added to reflect the joint mCSD query model. Sources are cited where requirements extend 347 
beyond OpenHIE. 348

GOVERNANCE 
Governance of the Health Workforce Registry follows the cross-cutting governance 
framework in Section 3.4 of the guidance document. Component-specific 
considerations include:  
(1) The Health Workforce Registry has a structurally complex multi -institutional 
governance context. Professional licensing authorities, Ministries of Health, employer 
HR systems, training institutions, and subnational health administrations are all 
authoritative sources for different attributes of a health worker record. The governance 
framework should specify which institution is the steward for each attribute type, and 
what verification is required before an attribute can be published.  
(2) Licence status data has direct patient safety implications: a system that publishes 
an incorrect licence status — particularly one that shows a revoked licence as active 
— can contribute to a patient safety incident. Governance should therefore specify  
the maximum permissible latency between a licensing authority revoking a licence 
and that change being reflected in the registry, and should define the incident 
response process for discovered discrepancies.  
(3) Health workers have a direct personal interest in their own registry record — their 
ability to practise depends on it. Governance should provide a defined process for 
health workers to review their own record, raise disputes, and have errors corrected 
within a specified timeframe.  
   
 
144 
(4) For community health workers and cadres without formal professional regulation, 
the governance framework should specify which institution is responsible for 
maintaining their registry records, how their identity is verified at registration, and what 
attributes are required.
