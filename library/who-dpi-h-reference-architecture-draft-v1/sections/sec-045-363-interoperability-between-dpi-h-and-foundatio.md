842 
Earlier in this guidance it is observed that general-purpose data exchange DPI are designed to 843 
move data securely between application components, and that health requires more than 844 
secure transport. The additional properties the health sector requires — that exchanged data be 845 
clinically meaningful, structurally consistent, and governed by consent rules granular enough to 846 
reflect the sensitivity of individual health encounters — are not properties that the transport itself 847 
should supply. These are properties of the digital health systems that communicate, the shared 848 
specifications those systems conform to, and the governance arrangements around them — 849 
exercised at the endpoints of an exchange over a neutral transport. 850 
 851 
Foundational data-exchange DPI provides secure, auditable, non-repudiable transport between 852 
authenticated endpoints, and the health-specific requirements are met by the communicating 853 
   
 
75 
components and by the shared content, terminology and information-model specifications those 854 
components implement. 855 
 856 
This is important for governance because if the transport were to embed clinical semantics, 857 
adjudicate consent, or correlate records, then whoever operates the transport would become 858 
accountable for clinical governance decisions that properly belong to health authorities and to 859 
the custodians of health data. That would concentrate control inappropriately and create the 860 
single points of failure and political bottlenecks the architecture warns against. The foundational 861 
exchange substrate should therefore move and log health data faithfully without transforming or 862 
interpreting its clinical content; semantic alignment should take place at the source. 863 
 864 
Foundational data exchange DPI of the kind described in cross-sector specifications provides 865 
this substrate: a gateway through which authenticated participants publish and consume 866 
services and event notifications over open, REST-based interfaces; standardised data formats 867 
at the boundary between systems; signed and timestamped transaction logs that support audit 868 
and non-repudiation; and the data-sharing agreements that govern who may access which 869 
service.29 Such exchange is recommended for communication across networks and is not 870 
required between co-located systems — a further reason not to treat it as a mandatory central 871 
component. Where a country already operates mature foundational data exchange DPI, the 872 
health sector can reuse it rather than build a parallel capability. Where foundational DPI is not 873 
yet in place, the health sector may need to implement exchange capability of its own in the 874 
interim, designed so that it can align with national DPI as that matures. The health sector's 875 
legitimate extension of foundational exchange is therefore semantic and clinical; it is not a 876 
duplication of transport. 877 
 878 
Exchange patterns are an implementation choice, and the architecture does not prescribe one. 879 
Countries variously achieve exchange through a distributed model, in which each participating 880 
organisation operates its own access point and a central authority provides registration, logging 881 
and oversight; through a centralised service bus that mediates all traffic; through gateways that 882 
protect and mediate the interfaces of individual components; or through direct, standards-883 
conforming connections between systems. These patterns can coexist within a single country, 884 
each applied where it is most appropriate — for example, centralised handling of demographic 885 
look-ups alongside distributed exchange of clinical documents between facilities. What the 886 
reference architecture describes is not a particular pattern, but that exchange, however it is 887 
implemented, conforms to open specifications, authenticates and audits its participants, and 888 
avoids the accumulation of unmanaged bilateral connections. Asynchronous, store-and-forward 889 
exchange — including publish-and-subscribe eventing — additionally allows endpoints to 890 
continue operating where connectivity is intermittent and to synchronise when it is restored, a 891 
common requirement in lower-resource settings. A health facility that registers a birth, for 892 
example, can publish that event once, allowing the civil registration system and the electronic 893 
 
29 GovStack Information Mediator Building Block — description, cross-cutting requirements (standardised interchange formats; 
asynchronous-first pub/sub), and functional requirements (distributed access points, signed and timestamped message logs, audit, 
monitoring, data-sharing-agreement governance)

immunisation registry each to act on it without the facility maintaining a separate connection to 894 
either. 895

Figure 3.6 — Exchange patterns that can coexist within a single country. The same set of systems may be connected 899 
through any of these mechanisms, chosen according to context; the architecture does not prescribe one. 900

Legend 
• System (navy) — a participating system or component that sends or receives data. 
• Access point (AP) — a participating organisation's own connection point in a distributed 
model. 
• Gateway — a component-specific interface that protects and mediates access to that 
component. 
• Service bus — shared infrastructure through which all traffic is routed. 
• Event broker — shared infrastructure that distributes a published event to its subscribers. 
• Solid line — exchange of data between endpoints. 
• Dashed line — registration, logging and oversight, carrying no data content. 
• Arrow — direction of event flow in the publish–subscribe model. 
 
The exchange pattern a country adopts is an implementation choice. Direct connections link systems 
point-to-point, conforming to open national specifications. A central service bus instead mediates all 
traffic through a single shared channel. Gateways place a protective, mediating interface in front of 
each component. In the distributed access-point model, each participating organisation (administrative 
unit of participation) operates its own access point and a central authority provides registration, logging 
and oversight without sitting in the path of the data itself. Publish–subscribe exchange is 
asynchronous: a system publishes an event once, and any authorised subscriber receives it without 
   
 
77 
the publisher addressing each recipient directly; because it is store-and-forward, it also allows 
endpoints to continue operating where connectivity is intermittent and to synchronise when it is 
restored. 
 
These patterns are not mutually exclusive. A single country may use several at once — for example, 
centralised handling of demographic look-ups alongside distributed exchange of clinical documents 
between facilities, and publish–subscribe eventing where a facility that registers a birth publishes that 
event once for a civil registration system and an immunisation registry each to act upon. What the 
architecture asks is not a particular pattern, but that exchange, however it is implemented, conforms to 
open national specifications, authenticates and audits its participants, and avoids the accumulation of 
unmanaged bilateral connections.
