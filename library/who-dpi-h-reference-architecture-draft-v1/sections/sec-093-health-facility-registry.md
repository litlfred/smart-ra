Core Registries for Health  ·  DPI-H Foundational Layer   3

ARCHITECTURE 
PLACEMENT 
AND KEY 
DISTINCTION 
The Health Facility Registry is a core DPI-H foundational component — the national 
authoritative source of identity, location, and classification data for health facilities. 
It is closely related to two other concepts that warrants distinction. The Master 
Facility List (MFL) is the standardised dataset that the Health Facility Registry 
produces and governs — the registry is the technology; the MFL is the data. The 
Common Geo -Registry (CGR) is a cross -sectoral foundational component that 
manages geographic o bjects (administrative units, settlements, boundaries) with 
temporal integrity. The Health Facility Registry would depend on a CGR (where it 
exists) for its geographic reference data but is not the same thing: the CGR governs 
geography; the Health Facility  Registry governs health facilities positioned within 
that geography.

1  WHAT IT IS 
 6 
The Health Facility Registry is the national authoritative source of identity, location, and classification data 7 
for all facilities, locations, and organisations through which health services are delivered or that are of direct 8 
relevance to the Ministry of Health’s mandate. This scope is intentionally broader than a list of permanent 9 
clinical facilities. It encompasses: permanent clinical facilities such as hospitals, health centres, clinics, 10 
pharmacies, and laboratories; logistics facilities such as warehouses and distribution centres; community 11 
health posts and outreach sites; temporary and campaign facilities such as vaccination posts, emergency 12 
field hospitals, and mobile clinics established for specific programmes or emergencies; and, where 13 
nationally defined, other locations whose activities intersect with public health responsibilities. The registry 14 
covers facilities across all sectors: public, private, faith -based, and NGO. A single standardised, uniquely 15 
identified, and centrally governed record is maintained for each facility, providing the common reference 16 
against which clinical, financial, logistical, and administrative systems can consistently identify and locate 17 
the places where health services are delivered. 18 
The registry and the Master Facility List are closely related but architecturally distinct. The Health Facility 19 
Registry is the system — the technology, governance processes, and workflows that collect, validate, 20 
maintain, and publish facility data. The Master Facility List (MFL) is the output of that system: the 21 
standardised, uniquely coded list of all active facilities that the registry produces and keeps current. A 22 
country may have an MFL without having a formal Health Facility Registry; the DPI-H reference architecture 23 
calls for the registry infrastructure that makes the MFL reliable, interoperable, and sustainably maintained. 24 
An important architectural principle underlies the design of the Health Facility Registry: facilities, buildings, 25 
locations, and organisations are distinct entities that should not be conflated. A facility is a defined health 26 
service delivery unit — it has a scope of services, an operator, and a governance status. A building is a 27 
physical structure: a facility may operate across multiple buildings, or multiple facilities may share one 28 
building. A location is a geographic reference: a facility may have a primary location and satellite locations 29 
or move entirely. An organisation is the legal entity that operates the facility. Keeping these distinctions 30 
clear matters for practical registry design. A facility that relocates to a new building retains its identity and 31 
service history. A temporary vaccination post is a distinct facility record with its own lifecycle, linked to the 32 
organising entity but not absorbed into a permanent facility’s record. An organisation that operates multiple 33 
facilities appears in a separate organisational register but is linked to many facility records. These 34 
distinctions also underpin the principle of referential integrity: each entity should be managed in one 35 
authoritative place and referenced everywhere else, not duplicated across systems. 36 
   
 
125 
The geographic dimension of the Health Facility Registry deserves particular attention. Facilities exist at 37 
specific geographic locations within administrative and reporting hierarchies that change over time — 38 
districts split, boundaries are redrawn, new administrative levels are created. A Health Facility Registry that 39 
treats geographic location as a static attribute quickly becomes unreliable for aggregate reporting, 40 
particularly when data from different periods needs to be compared across changing administrative 41 
boundaries. Managing this temporal dimension — knowing not just where a facility is now but which 42 
administrative unit it belonged to on a given date — is one of the most technically and institutionally 43 
demanding aspects of facility data governance. 44 
 45 
2  WHY IT MATTERS FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES 
 46 
Effective health service delivery, financing, and planning all depend on knowing where health facilities are, 47 
what they do, and whether they are operational. Without a reliable, interoperable health facility registry, 48 
every system in the health ecosystem maintains its own local version of the facility list — and those lists 49 
may diverge. For example, a logistics management system may route supplies to facilities that may not 50 
always match to the claims system's provider identifiers; there may be difficulty in attributing a case report 51 
to the correct administrative unit because its facility list references a district that was divided in a prior 52 
period; and health system managers may face challenges with reimbursing services at facilities whose 53 
operational status have not been updated since the last manual audit. 54 
These examples reflect conditions of health systems that lack a governed health facility registry. The 55 
consequences, not merely administrative inconvenience, result in reduced ability to allocate resources 56 
equitably, reduced visibility of where the health system is and is not functioning, and reduced capacity to 57 
respond to health emergencies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the absence of geolocated, current facility 58 
data in many countries made it materially harder to plan vaccine delivery, identify capacity gaps, and route 59 
supplies. This gap was a key motivation for the WHO Geolocated Health Facilities Data initiative, which 60 
notes that the pandemic exposed urgent gaps in countries’ ability to locate health facilities, impeding 61 
equitable access to diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines (WHO, Geolocated Health Facilities Data 62 
initiative, 2022; https://www.who.int/data/GIS/GHFD ). 63 
When a Health Facility Registry is in place, current and maintained, the entire health information 64 
infrastructure gains a stable geographic anchor with benefits to health service users and health systems 65 
stakeholders alike; and while it does not deliver these outcomes directly, it provides the stable reference 66 
on which they become possible. For example: 67 
• Accurate attribution of health workers to their deployed facilities, supporting workforce planning and 68 
accountability.  69 
• Routing and delivery of health products and commodities to verified locations.  70 
• Validation of health coverage scheme claims against known, empanelled providers.  71 
• Modelling of service coverage by planners against population distribution.  72 
• Aggregation of case data across administrative hierarchies for public health surveillance, with 73 
confidence that the boundaries used are consistent over time.  74 
 75 
3  CORE ATTRIBUTES 
 76 
– Facility identity and master record management. Creation, maintenance, and publication of 77 
authoritative identity records for all facilities within the scope of the Ministry of Health's mandate — 78 
including permanent clinical facilities, logistics facilities, temporary and campaign facilities, and 79 
other locations nationally designated as relevant to public health oversight — across all sectors 80 
and facility types, with a unique, persistent, nationally assigned facility identifier as the canonical 81 
cross-system reference key. 82 
   
 
126 
– Multi-axial hierarchy management. Definition and maintenance of three distinct types of location 83 
hierarchy, each of which should be managed independently because they frequently differ: (1) the 84 
administrative hierarchy, reflecting political and health administrative divisions used for reporting 85 
and resource allocation; (2) the operational or health-specific hierarchy, reflecting operational 86 
districts, programme reporting structures, and health system management units that may not align 87 
with political boundaries; and (3) the referral and catchment hierarchy, reflecting the referral chains 88 
and population catchment areas that define how patients flow between facilities. Hierarchical 89 
relationships should be defined as explicit linkages with periods of validity, not as intrinsic 90 
attributes of the facility record, to accommodate boundary and restructuring changes over time. 91 
– Catchment area management. Capture and maintenance of each facility's catchment area, either 92 
as an enumeration of communities or villages served or as a geographic boundary, enabling equity 93 
analysis and population-based coverage measurement. 94 
– Geographic location management with temporal integrity. Maintenance of precise geographic 95 
coordinates for each facility and their linkage to the relevant administrative units in each hierarchy, 96 
with full period-of-validity records so that any system can determine which administrative unit a 97 
facility was assigned to on any given historical date. This attribute depends on — and may be 98 
synchronised with — a Common Geo-Registry or equivalent geospatial reference source where 99 
available at the foundational DPI level. 100 
– Facility status and service change management. Management of facility operational status 101 
changes (opening, closure, temporary closure, service additions or removals) with effective dates, 102 
enabling consuming systems to reflect current service availability and enabling retrospective 103 
analysis of service history. 104 
– Configurable attribute schema and data dictionary governance. Ability to define, extend, and 105 
evolve the set of attributes captured per facility record, referenced against the canonical schema 106 
maintained in a Logical Information Model Repository, and governed through a defined change 107 
management process. 108 
– Multi-identifier cross-referencing. Maintenance of all known identifiers assigned to a facility 109 
across different systems — including location codes assigned by aggregate reporting and 110 
surveillance platforms, Global Location Numbers (GLNs), supply chain location codes, provider 111 
codes for health coverage schemes, and others — as cross-references to the canonical facility 112 
identifier, enabling identity resolution across systems that use different local identifier schemes. 113 
– Standards-based access and interoperability. 114 
● Mobile and temporary facility management. Support for facilities that operate temporarily, 115 
move location, or are established for specific campaigns or emergencies — including vaccination 116 
posts, emergency field hospitals, and mobile clinics — with full lifecycle management (activation, 117 
relocation, deactivation) and explicit linkage to the permanent facilities or organising entities 118 
responsible for them. Temporary facility records are distinct from permanent records and should 119 
be managed accordingly, including retrospective preservation of the services delivered and 120 
populations served during their active period. 121 
● Standards-based access and interoperability. Exposure of facility data through standards-122 
based APIs enabling any conformant system to query, retrieve, and receive updates on facility 123 
records in a consistent and portable manner. 124 
 125 
4  HOW IT CONNECTS 
 126 
Relationship with a Common Geo-Registry 127 
The most architecturally significant dependency of the Health Facility Registry is on geospatial infrastructure 128 
— specifically a Common Geo-Registry (CGR); a cross-sectoral foundational component that sits outside 129 
the health sector and serves the whole of government 50. A CGR would manage geographic objects — 130 
 
50 https://healthgeolab.net/DOCUMENTS/Guidance_Common_Geo-registry_Ve2.pdf 
   
 
127 
administrative units, settlements, boundaries, and their hierarchical relationships — with full temporal 131 
integrity: it would record not just current geographies but historical changes, enabling any system to query 132 
the state of a geography on any given date. 133 
The Health Facility Registry would depend on the CGR for two things: 134 
• First, it would use CGR -assigned administrative unit identifiers as the geographic anchors for its 135 
hierarchy linkages — the facility would not be assigned to a named district by the registry itself, but 136 
to the CGR's persistent identifier for that district, which resolves correctly even after boundaries 137 
change.  138 
• Second, when the CGR records a boundary change such as a district splitting, merging of counties 139 
or creation of a new administrative level, it would notify dependent registries, including the Health 140 
Facility Registry, so that affected facility linkages can be reviewed and updated. This notification 141 
and propagation model, consistent with the approach described in the Health GeoLab Collaborative 142 
Common Geo-Registry Guidance Version 2 1, is the mechanism that would prevent geographic 143 
reference data from silently becoming stale.  144 
This embodies the principle of authoritative sources and referential integrity: geographic data should be 145 
maintained once in a CGR and referenced by the Health Facility Registry — not duplicated — so that a 146 
change in one place propagates correctly to all dependent systems rather than creating divergent copies 147 
that need to be manually reconciled. 148 
Where a functioning CGR is not available at the foundational level — as is the case in many countries today 149 
— it is important that the Health Facility Registry manages its geographic reference data internally, 150 
accepting the limitations this creates for multi-system geographic consistency. This is a common practical 151 
situation that the reference architecture acknowledges, as in many cases, the health sector is unable to  152 
wait for foundational geospatial DPI to be fully developed, but its implementations should be designed with 153 
the expectation of eventual integration with a CGR as that foundational layer matures. 154 
 155 
Relationship with other DPI-H components 156 
• The Health Facility Registry is one of the three master data pillars — product, facility, provider — that 157 
together support all supply chain transactions. The Health Facility Registry provides the location data, 158 
the Product Registry provides the commodity data, and the Health Workforce Registry provides the 159 
provider data. Together they enable end -to-end attribution. The supply chain also depends on it for 160 
delivery routing and cold chain facility classification 161 
• The Health Workforce Registry is the Health Facility Registry's most direct operational peer. Health 162 
workers are affiliated with facilities; facilities are served by health workers. The IHE Mobile Care 163 
Services Discovery (mCSD) profile is designed to be queried across both components simultaneously, 164 
enabling a system to ask 'which doctors are currently deployed at facilities in this district?' through a 165 
single standards -based query. Implementations of both components should be designed for 166 
compliance to standards such as mCSD to enable this joint query capability. 167 
• Clinical and administrative systems all depend on the Health Facility Registry to attribute health events 168 
to verified facility locations. For example, a clinical record is associated with the facility that created it 169 
and a consent record notes which facilities have access to a patient's data. In each case the facility 170 
identifier used should trace to a canonical record in the Health Facility Registry, not to a local code that 171 
may be inconsistent with other systems. 172 
• The Benefits Package Registry depends on the Health Facility Registry for provider empanelment — 173 
determining which facilities are contracted to deliver services under a given benefit package, and at 174 
what tier. Health coverage scheme claims systems, as functional/operational systems that consume 175 
DPI-H components, similarly rely on verified facility data for claims validation.  176 
• Financial management systems also depend on the Health Facility Registry for budget attribution and 177 
payment routing.  178 
   
 
128 
• The Terminology Service provides the standardised codes used for facility type, ownership category, 179 
and service classification — ensuring that the same facility type means the same thing across all 180 
systems that consume facility data. 181 
 182 
5  FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
 183 
Requirements are grouped by business process and draw on the OpenHIE Facility Registry specification 184 
(FRF-1 to FRF -14; FRWF -1), expert feedback, the WHO/USAID MFL Resource Package, the UNICEF 185 
Health Facility Registry Toolkit (2024), and WHO Geolocated Health Facilities Data initiative. Where 186 
requirements extend or elevate beyond OpenHIE, this is noted. Several OpenHIE requirements are 187 
adjusted: FRF-3 (minimum dataset) is elevated to Required given the WHO GHFD initiative's alignment; 188 
FRF-6 (standards-based APIs) is elevated to Required; and versioning is elevated to Required to reflect 189 
the expert consensus on its criticality for temporal data integrity. 190

Record date Date the record was created and date of last update. Mandatory 
Contact 
information 
Telephone number(s), email address, and where applicable 
postal address. Mandatory 
Common and 
mapped identifiers 
All known identifiers assigned to the facility by other systems, 
maintained as cross-references to the canonical identifier. Mandatory 
Type of services 
offered 
Services available at the facility (e.g., emergency care, ANC, 
laboratory, HIV treatment, TB, surgery, pharmacy), using 
standardised service classification codes from the Terminology 
Service. 
Recommended 
Human resources 
for health — 
numbers by cadre 
Count of health workers deployed at the facility by cadre, linked 
to the Health Workforce Registry. Supports workforce distribution 
analysis. 
Recommended 
Infrastructure 
attributes 
Key infrastructure indicators including availability of electricity, 
water, sanitation, and internet connectivity. Relevant for cold 
chain siting, telemedicine eligibility, and service readiness 
assessments. 
Recommended 
Opening and 
closing times 
Regular operating hours, including any service-specific hours that 
differ from general hours. Recommended

Notes: (1) The WHO GHFD initiative identifies four minimum data elements for any global health facility 212 
record: Name, Type, Location (geographic coordinates), and Unique ID. These four are the minimum for 213 
international comparability. All other elements in the signature domain are required for full national registry 214 
functionality. (2) Facility type classification should be governed through the Terminology Service, not as a 215 
free-text field, to ensure cross-system comparability. (3) Administrative hierarchy linkages should reference 216 
the canonical identifiers from the Common Geo -Registry (where available) or national administrative unit 217 
register, not locally assigned text names. (4) The service domain elements are marked Recommended; 218 
their completeness depends on country capacity and use case requirements. 219

GOVERNANCE 
Governance of the Health Facility Registry follows the cross -cutting governance 
framework in Section 3.4 of the guidance document. Component -specific 
considerations include:  
 
(1) The Health Facility Registry typically has multiple institutional data contributors — 
Ministries of Health, subnational health administrations, professional councils, and 
faith-based and NGO facility networks — each with legitimate authority over different 
subsets of facility data. The governance framework should clearly define which 
institution is the steward for each facility type, what verification is required before a 
new facility can be published, and what approval is needed before a closure is 
recorded. Faith-based and private sector facility data is a particular challenge in many 
countries. In several sub -Saharan African and South Asian countries, a substantial 
proportion of health services — in some cases exceeding 30% of total service delivery 
— is provided by faith -based or private sector facilities that maintain their own 
administrative hierarchies (WHO/USAID MFL Resource Package, 2019). A national 
Health Facility Registry that covers only public sector facilities would not fulfil its full 
function.  
(2) Hierarchy changes require coordinated cross -institutional governance. When a 
district is divided, every system that aggregates data by district — surveillance, HMIS, 
supply chain — is affected. The governance framework should specify who has 
authority to update hierarchy linkages, what notification is required before a change 
is implemented, and what retrospective recalculation obligations apply for historical 
indicators.  
(3) The distinction between provenance and ownership of facility data should be 
defined. A facility may be owned by a faith-based organisation but listed in a national 
public registry; the data custodian (the Ministry of Health) and the data owner (the 
facility operator) have different governance roles and rights. The governance 
framework should address this explicitly.  
(4) The Health Facility Registry should be designed as a public good: facility identity 
and location data, at minimum, should be publicly accessible in alignment with the 
WHO GHFD initiative's open data objectives and the principle that patients and 
communities have a right to know where health services are available.
