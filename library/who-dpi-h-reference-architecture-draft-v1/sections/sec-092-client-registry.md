ARCHITECTURE 
PLACEMENT 
The Client Registry is a core DPI -H foundational component — the shared identity 
anchor for the entire health ecosystem. It does not duplicate or replace national 
foundational identification systems (civil registries, national IDs). Where a 
foundational ID  system exists, the Client Registry references and leverages it. 
Where one does not, the Client Registry provides the health sector's own identity 
resolution capability. In both cases, it is the single authoritative source of health -
specific person identit y and identifier cross -referencing within the DPI -H 
architecture. 
 46 
1  WHAT IT IS 
 47 
The Client Registry is the national authoritative source of health -specific person identity. It is the 48 
foundational health-sector component that maintains a unique, verifiable identity record for every person 49 
who accesses health services and provides the identity resolution services that allow other systems to 50 
consistently identify that same person across the fragmented landscape of health information systems. It 51 
holds the minimum set of demographic attributes needed to uniquely identify a person, assigns and 52 
manages health-specific unique identifiers, links multiple local or system -specific identifiers to a single 53 
person record, and resolves ambiguous matches through deduplication and probabilistic matching. 54 
The Client Registry is not a clinical record. It holds identity data — who a person is — not health data that 55 
describes what has happened to them. Its purpose is to ensure that every other system that records, stores, 56 
or exchanges health data about a person can be certain it is referring to the same individual. Without that 57 
assurance, person -centred care, longitudinal health records, and cross -programme data aggregation 58 
cannot be achieved with the reliability or integrity that health system decision-making requires. 59 
In the DPI-H reference architecture, the Client Registry may also be described as a Master Patient Index 60 
(MPI) or Enterprise Master Patient Index (EMPI), particularly in contexts where the scope spans multiple 61 
health care organisations or information systems. The term 'Client Registry' is used here in preference to 62 
'patient registry' to reflect the broad range of interactions a person has with the health system — as a 63 
patient, a carer, a health service user, or a community member — none of which are fully captured by the 64 
clinical connotations of 'patient'. 65 
 66 
2  WHY IT MATTERS FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES 
 67 
Person-centred care depends on knowing who the person is. A clinician ordering a test, dispensing a 68 
medicine, or reviewing a referral needs confidence that the record they are looking at belongs to the person 69 
in front of them — not a near-duplicate created by a different facility, a name variant, or a data entry error. 70 
When that confidence is absent, the integrity of every clinical decision that depends on it is at risk. At scale, 71 
fragmented identity produces fragmented data: disease surveillance is unreliable, population health 72 
indicators are inflated by duplicates, and programme performance cannot be measured with integrity. 73 
The stakes are higher for vulnerable populations. People who access services under different names — 74 
due to stigma, discrimination, or transient living circumstances — are especially susceptible to identity 75 
fragmentation. Migrants and refugees without foundational identification documents risk being invisible to 76 
the health system entirely. Children born outside formal registration systems may be denied services. A 77 
   
 
116 
well-designed Client Registry, drawing on inclusive identity approaches and supporting multiple identifier 78 
types, is itself a health equity instrument. 79 
When a Client Registry is in place and functioning, every system it connects to gains the ability to produce 80 
a longitudinal view of an individual's health encounters — across facilities, programmes, and time periods. 81 
This is the enabling condition for a Lifelong Health Record, for cross -programme care coordination, for 82 
financial protection through accurate beneficiary identification, and for trustworthy public health 83 
surveillance. The Client Registry does not deliver these outcomes directly; it makes them structurally 84 
achievable. 85 
 86 
3  CORE ATTRIBUTES 
 87 
– Person identity record management. Creation, maintenance, and lifecycle management of 88 
demographic records for individuals accessing health services, including support for newborns, 89 
minors, and persons with incomplete or provisional demographic information. 90 
– Health Unique Identifier (HUID) assignment and management. Assignment of a nationally 91 
unique, non-intelligent health identifier to each registered person, and management of that 92 
identifier throughout the person's engagement with the health system — including across name 93 
changes, demographic updates, and administrative boundary changes. 94 
– Multi-identifier management and cross-referencing. Storage and management of multiple 95 
identifiers per person — including the HUID, foundational identifiers (national ID, CRVS number), 96 
and local facility or programme identifiers — and the cross-referencing mappings that allow any 97 
one of these to resolve to the person's canonical record. 98 
– Identity resolution and deduplication. Application of configurable matching algorithms — both 99 
probabilistic and deterministic — to detect and resolve duplicate records, link records representing 100 
the same person, and maintain deduplication at scale as new records are submitted from multiple 101 
sources. 102 
– Identity verification and assurance. Support for verification of a person's identity against external 103 
authoritative sources, including foundational ID systems, biometric services, and civil registration, 104 
providing differentiated assurance levels to consuming systems. 105 
– Relationship and household management. Persistence of defined relationships between 106 
registered persons — parent-child, household membership, spousal — supporting family-based 107 
care coordination, child health linkage, and household-level eligibility assessment for health 108 
financing schemes. 109 
– Privacy-preserving and inclusive identity services. Support for pseudo-anonymisation of 110 
person identifiers for population-level analysis and research; inclusive registration pathways for 111 
persons without foundational documentation; and compliance with applicable data protection 112 
frameworks including right-to-be-forgotten and data correction rights. 113 
– Standards-based identity APIs. Exposure of machine-readable, standards-based APIs 114 
supporting identity creation, query, cross-referencing, and subscription, enabling any conformant 115 
system to resolve and exchange person identity data consistently. 116 
 117 
4  HOW IT CONNECTS 
 118 
Relationship with foundational identification systems 119 
The relationship between the Client Registry and foundational identification infrastructure is the most 120 
architecturally significant dependency in the health identity domain, and the one most frequently 121 
misunderstood. It is therefore given dedicated treatment here. 122 
Foundational ID systems — civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems, national ID systems, and 123 
population registers — exist to provide legal identity to the general population for a wide range of civic, 124 
   
 
117 
administrative, and social transactions. They are owned and governed outside the health sector. They are 125 
the authoritative source for a person's legal identity: name, date of birth, sex, and nationality. They are not 126 
owned by the health sector, and the Client Registry does not replicate them. 127 
Functional health ID systems, including the Health Unique Identifier (HUID), are created to manage 128 
identification for the specific use cases of health service delivery. They may or may not be linked to 129 
foundational ID, depending on a country's context. The WHO HUID Guidance (2023) identifies three primary 130 
implementation models that countries have adopted: 131 
– Model A — HUID linked to national ID or CRVS. Where a robust foundational ID system exists, 132 
the HUID is derived from or permanently linked to the foundational identifier. The Client Registry 133 
stores the linkage and uses the foundational ID as the primary identity proofing source. This 134 
reduces duplication and strengthens the accuracy of identity resolution. 135 
– Model B — HUID not linked to national ID. Where a foundational ID system is absent, unreliable, 136 
or inaccessible to the health sector, the health system creates its own functional identifier 137 
independently. The Client Registry is the authoritative source for this health-specific identifier and 138 
manages its own identity proofing processes. 139 
– Model C — Multiple local health IDs linked through an EMPI. Where multiple facilities or 140 
programmes have each assigned their own local identifiers to the same population, the Client 141 
Registry functions as an Enterprise Master Patient Index — maintaining a cross-reference map 142 
that links these local identifiers to a single canonical person record. 143 
In all three models, the Client Registry does not duplicate foundational ID data or attempt to replicate civil 144 
registration. Where a foundational ID exists, the Client Registry stores the identifier as a reference attribute 145 
and may query the foundational system to verify identity at registration; it does not absorb or maintain the 146 
authoritative record. Where foundational ID is absent, the Client Registry is the health sector's fallback, not 147 
a substitute for foundational infrastructure. 148 
Countries should be aware that linking a health identifier to a national ID or social protection registry creates 149 
both opportunities and risks. The opportunity is stronger identity assurance and more accurate cross -150 
programme coordination. The risk is that health data becomes accessible to actors outside the health 151 
sector, or that individuals in vulnerable circumstances — undocumented migrants, people accessing 152 
stigmatised services, stateless persons — may be deterred from seeking care if health identity is tied to 153 
civic registration. The reference architecture does not prescribe which model a country should adopt; it 154 
requires that whichever model is chosen, the linkage decisions and their implications are governed explicitly 155 
and transparently. 156 
 157 
Relationship with other DPI-H components 158 
Within the DPI -H reference architecture, the Client Registry is a dependency for almost every other 159 
component, because nearly every health transaction involves a person whose identity must be resolved. 160 
The Lifelong Health Record depends on the Client Registry to anchor clinical data to a verified person 161 
record. The Benefits Package Registry depend on it to confirm the identity of individuals being enrolled in 162 
health financing schemes. The Facility Registry cross -references it to record which facilities a person has 163 
attended. Public health surveillance systems use it for deduplication of case reports. Consent management 164 
services reference it to record which person has granted or withdrawn consent for specific data uses. 165 
The Health Workforce Registry is an analogous component in the provider domain — it does for health 166 
workers what the Client Registry does for health service users. The two are architecturally parallel and 167 
share many functional patterns, including multi-identifier management, deduplication, and standards-based 168 
API conventions. 169 
The Client Registry schema — the logical structure defining which demographic attributes are stored and 170 
how they are typed, constrained, and related — is a concern of the Logical Information Model Repository. 171 
The LIMR holds the canonical model; the Client Registry implements it. Changes to the schema should be 172 
proposed, reviewed, and approved through the LIMR's governance process before being implemented. The 173 
Terminology Service provides the coded value sets for key attributes such as sex, gender, administrative 174 
territory, language, and relationship type. 175 
   
 
118 
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) supports identity verification and credential management — particularly 176 
where biometric verification or digital identity credentials are used for high-assurance authentication at point 177 
of care. The Client Registry may consume PKI services to validate identity credentials presented at 178 
registration or service access, but PKI is a foundational DPI component that sits outside the health sector. 179 
 180

Note: Requirements CRF-1 through CRF-10 align with the OpenHIE Client Registry specification. The 189 
DPI-H reference architecture extends OpenHIE in five respects: (1) multi-identifier management is 190 
elevated to Required; (2) access control (CRF-9) is elevated from Recommended to Required; (3) 191 
unlinkage and merge reversal are explicitly added; (4) inclusive registration for persons without 192 
foundational documentation is made an explicit requirement; and (5) pseudo-anonymisation and data 193 
protection regulatory compliance are introduced as new requirements reflecting the broader DPI-H 194 
governance context. 195

6  DATA REQUIREMENTS 
 196 
The following table defines the minimum dataset for a person record in the Client Registry. It draws on the 197 
WHO HUID Guidance (2023), the HL7 FHIR Patient resource and the IHE PMIR profile minimum attribute 198 
set. Requirement status reflects the minimum requirement for a record to support identity resolution and 199 
cross-system use.  200 
Note: This is illustrative rather than an exhaustive list and countries can extend based on needs. 201 
 202 
Data element Description Requirement

123 
Data element Description Requirement 
Status 
Biometric data Biometric attributes (fingerprint, iris, facial image) where 
legally permitted and technically supported, for high -
assurance identity verification. 
Optional 
Record creation 
and update 
metadata 
Dates of record creation, last update, and the source 
system or user who made the change. Mandatory 
 203 
Notes: (1) 'Biometric data' is listed as Optional rather than Recommended. Its use requires a formal privacy 204 
impact assessment, an explicit legal basis, and an equity analysis to confirm it does not create access 205 
barriers for populations with unreadable biometrics (elderly, manual workers, persons with disabilities). (2) 206 
Countries should not embed personally identifiable attributes — name, date of birth, location — within the 207 
HUID code itself. The HUID should be an opaque, non-intelligent identifier. (3) The minimum dataset above 208 
reflects the nationally held Client Registry record; facility -level systems may collect additional clinical 209 
demographic attributes that do not need to be federated to the national registry. 210 
GOVERNANCE 
Governance of the Client Registry follows the cross-cutting governance framework in 
Section 3.4 of the guidance document. Component-specific considerations include:  
 
(1) The Client Registry sits at the intersection of health, civil registration, social 
protection, and potentially financial services. Its governance should be explicitly multi-
sectoral: a single Ministry of Health cannot unilaterally govern a component whose 
data is referenced across government. A formal governance body with mandated 
participation from health, civil registration, and data protection authorities is required.  
 
(2) The decision of whether to link the HUID to a foundational identifier — and to which 
one — is a policy decision with significant privacy, equity, and institutional 
implications. This decision should be taken at the highest appropriate level of 
government, supported by a privacy impact assessment and a legal framework, 
before technical implementation proceeds.  
 
(3) The right to be registered should be universal. Governance should ensure that 
absence of foundational documentation never becomes grounds for denial of health 
identity or service access.  
 
(4) Merge and link decisions that affect a person's health record should be reviewable 
by the person themselves where technically and legally feasible, consistent with data 
subject rights under applicable frameworks.
