2.1.1 Metadata registries and foundational components 46 
The first layer comprises the shared components that are reusable not only across health 47 
programmes but potentially across sectors. These establish authoritative, shared references for 48 
the people, places, products and services, and workers within the health system; maintain the 49 
longitudinal record of an individual's health and care; and provide the semantic and structural 50 
foundations that make data consistently meaningful across the ecosystem. The core registries 51 
— for clients (health service users), health facilities, health workers, and products — sit in this 52 
layer, alongside the lifelong health record, terminology services, and the logical information 53 
model repository. A practical test for whether a component belongs in this layer asks whether it 54 
can be reused across many health domains, exposes a clean and stable interface, avoids 55 
locking countries into domain-specific implementations, and supports a foundational capability 56 
rather than programme-specific logic. Components that meet these criteria belong here; those 57 
that do not, belong at the application layer, and the description of their functional requirements 58 
falls outside the scope of this reference architecture. 59

2.1.2 Business services layer 61 
The second layer describes a grouping of health capabilities that national health systems strive 62 
to deliver across their principal domains — clinical care, public health, the health supply chain, 63 
and health financing — together with the shared components that enable them. It sets out what 64 
countries need to achieve through the lens of the capabilities required for each business service 65 
first and then describes the shared components that the health system uses to realise those 66 
capabilities. Clinical care, for instance, draws on a computable decision support engine that 67 
evaluates a patient's health record against computable clinical guidelines to deliver 68 
recommendations, alerts, and risk assessments at the point of care; health financing draws on 69 
the Benefits Package Registry to support benefit design, eligibility, and claims; supply chain 70 
   
 
26 
draws on a supplier registry to verify supplier credentials, inform procurement, and anchor 71 
product traceability; and public health and analytics services draw on health management 72 
information systems for programme monitoring and on public health surveillance platforms for 73 
outbreak detection and response. These business-service components build on the metadata 74 
registries and shared foundational components, and several serve more than one domain — 75 
health management information systems, for instance, support clinical quality monitoring, 76 
programme oversight, and financial accountability alike — which is what distinguishes shared 77 
infrastructure from a programme-specific tool. 78 
Beyond the two layers, there are certain capabilities that are properties of DPI-H as a whole 79 
rather than features of any single component, layer, or business service. Interoperability is not 80 
a component to be built once but a property that should pervade the architecture through shared 81 
standards, common data models, and defined exchange patterns. Governance is cross-cutting 82 
in the same way: it applies to every component and capability the architecture describes and is 83 
treated as an architecture design principle below and elaborated on in the governance sub-84 
chapter.  85
