● HL7 FHIR reference terminology service (tx.fhir.org) — the reference implementation of 85 
the FHIR Terminology Service specification, widely used for testing and reference.86 86 
● openEHR Clinical Knowledge Manager — an international, peer-reviewed repository of 87 
archetypes and templates supporting local adaptation of globally curated models.87 88 
● National FHIR profile registries — country-specific implementation guides and profiles (for 89 
example, Simplifier-based national registries), maintaining canonical structural definitions. 90

Australia's national digital health programme aligns a nationally governed, opt-out longitudinal record 94 
(My Health Record) with a FHIR-based interoperability framework, a national terminology service 95

and a set of national information-model profiles (AU Base). The record aggregates clinical 96 
documents, medication, immunisation and pathology data contributed from distributed source 97 
systems88, while decision-support and terminology governance are pursued alongside it as part of 98 
the same national capability. The transferable observation is the value of governing the record, 99 
terminology, information models and decision support as one coherent programme rather than as 100 
isolated investments, and the sustained effort required to drive contributing-system participation at 101 
scale. 102
