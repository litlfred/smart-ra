The business services layer holds the shared, reusable components that draw on and extend the 688 
foundational shared data layer for health (the core registries, the Lifelong Health Record, the 689 
   
 
71 
Terminology Service, and the LIMR ) to enable the more complex capabilities a health system 690 
delivers across clinical care, public health, analytics and governance, the health supply chain, 691 
and health financing. Like the foundational components, these are shared infrastructure rather 692 
than systems owned by or designed for a single programme: 693 
• Computable Decision Support Engine — delivers computable clinical guidance to point-694 
of-care systems, drawing on terminology, the lifelong health record, and other shared data. 695 
• Public Health Surveillance Platform — supports the detection, monitoring, and reporting 696 
of conditions and events across populations. 697 
• Health Management Information System  — supports aggregate and population -level 698 
reporting, dashboards, and indicator monitoring for planning, performance management, 699 
and governance, drawing on the shared data layer. It addresses cohort - and population-700 
level analytical questions, complementing the Computable Decision Support Engine, which 701 
acts at the level of the individual person and encounter. 702 
• Supplier Registry  — the authoritative source of identity, classification, and regulatory 703 
status of the suppliers engaged in the health supply chain, reusable across procurement, 704 
contract management, vendor performance, and traceability. It sits in this layer as a health 705 
supply chain domain component, that other business — health financing, for example — 706 
can also draw on. 707 
• Benefits Package Registry  — the authoritative record of the benefits and schemes that 708 
define what is covered, for whom, and under what conditions, reusable across health 709 
financing, clinical, and supply-chain functions. 710 
Countries typically build toward the business services layer progressively, as their foundational 711 
registries mature. It is no less essential to a complete, sustainable, and well -governed 712 
architecture. 713 
Together, these two layers describe the full scope of DPI-H application components: the shared 714 
data and semantic foundations, and the shared services that build on them. 715 
 716 
Full descriptions of all DPI-H application components, with their core attributes, functional and 717 
data requirements, and governance considerations, are provided in Appendix C. 718
