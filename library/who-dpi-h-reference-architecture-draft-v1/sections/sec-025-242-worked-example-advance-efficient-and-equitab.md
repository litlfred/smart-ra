Health financing determines whether funds reach providers in sufficient volume, are allocated 502 
equitably, are accounted for transparently, and protect people from hardship when they seek 503 
care. Digital infrastructure does not change what health financing has to achieve; it allows those 504 
functions to be carried out with greater accuracy, transparency, and efficiency. 505 
Whether a country finances health through taxation, insurance contributions, or a combination of 506 
these, the underlying capabilities are broadly consistent: planning, executing, and monitoring 507 
health budgets; raising and tracking revenue; determining who is covered and what they are 508 
entitled to; pooling and allocating funds; purchasing services and paying providers; defining the 509 
benefit package; and safeguarding funds and data against fraud and misuse. Mapped to the 510 
architecture, these capabilities draw very largely on shared infrastructure that already exists for 511 
other purposes: 512 
Table 2.4: Health financing capabilities and the DPI-H components that supports them 513 
Financing capability Supported by 
Identifying and confirming who is 
covered 
Client Registry (with foundational digital identity 
where available) 
Empanelling, accrediting, and 
credentialing providers Facility Registry, Health Workforce Registry 
Defining covered services, 
schemes, and entitlement rules Benefits Package Registry 
Pricing and reimbursing accurately Product Registry, Terminology Services 
Moving funds and reconciling 
payments 
Foundational payments DPI (consumed by claims 
and scheme systems) 
Exchanging financial and clinical 
data for payment Shared exchange standards (interoperability) 
The notable finding is how few new components health financing introduces. Almost everything 514 
it needs is met by shared infrastructure that other goals already require — the client registry to 515 
identify beneficiaries, the facility and workforce registries to empanel and credential providers, 516 
the product registry and terminology services to make reimbursement accurate. Only one 517 
genuinely new DPI-H component emerges from the financing analysis: the Benefits Package 518 
Registry, an authoritative reference for covered services, schemes, and entitlement rules that 519 
eligibility and purchasing functions across the system rely on. 520 
These shared components do not, by themselves, run a financing system. The work is carried 521 
out by the operational and functional applications that consume them — claims engines, 522 
scheme administration platforms, government financial management systems — which draw on 523 
   
 
40 
the shared infrastructure to enrol people, adjudicate claims, and pay providers. These 524 
applications sit outside DPI-H: the architecture enables them rather than defining them, and the 525 
shared components reduce the duplication and fragmentation they would otherwise carry. This 526 
is the pattern the mapping is designed to surface, and it holds across all seven health goals. 527 
Countries are encouraged to use the mapping spreadsheets in Appendix E as a reference when 528 
assessing their own capability gaps, sequencing investments, and making the case for shared 529 
infrastructure to financing authorities and development partners. Section 3.3 illustrates the 530 
architecture in practice with a worked example, and the complete set of formal architecture 531 
models is published as navigable views for readers who wish to engage with the architecture at 532 
that level of detail.533

3. The Reference Architecture for DPI-H 1 
The reference architecture translates the analytical work of the health goals mapping into a 2 
structured description that countries can use to design, assess, and sequence their digital health 3 
infrastructure investments. It is intended to help national teams and implementers plan, build, and 4 
evaluate health information systems that are interoperable, scalable, and aligned with established 5 
practice. By offering a common vocabulary and a shared structural model, it supports consistent 6 
description, comparison, and assessment of digital health architectures across different contexts 7 
and implementations. Its purpose is to connect health goals to the capabilities that serve them 8 
and the shared infrastructure that realises them, keeping investment decisions anchored to health 9 
outcomes rather than to the solutions that happen to be available. 10 
It is a reference model to be adapted, not a prescriptive architecture that countries must adhere 11 
to. It offers a common vocabulary and a set of elements from which each country composes an 12 
architecture suited to its own context — adopting, extending, or setting aside elements as local 13 
priorities and constraints require.  14 
This chapter is organised as follows: 15 
• Section 3.1 describes the modelling approach and the shared language used to express 16 
the architecture.  17 
• Section 3.2 explains how to read and navigate the reference architecture, which is 18 
maintained as a living model rather than a fixed picture.  19 
• Section 3.3 illustrates the approach through worked examples for some health goals.  20 
• Section 3.4 sets out the governance arrangements that surround the architecture. 21 
• Section 3.5 introduces the DPI -H application components, whose full descriptions are 22 
provided in appendix C. 23 
• Section 3.6 describes the interoperability architecture within DPI -H, through which these 24 
components work together as a coherent ecosystem 25
