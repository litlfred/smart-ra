People, and the care they need, cross borders — migrant and mobile workers, displaced 907 
populations, those seeking care abroad, and populations served by regional health initiatives — 908 
and infectious-disease events and other emergencies require information to move between 909 
jurisdictions quickly and reliably. Cross-border exchange rests on the same principles as 910 
national exchange: shared content standards, preserved meaning, and federated exchange 911 
through national gateways rather than a central supranational store of personal health data. 912 
 913 
Regional experience illustrates the pattern. In the European cross-border health services 914 
infrastructure, each participating country connects through a national contact point, and a set of 915 
shared core services provides common terminology, translation and interoperability functions; 916 
on this basis countries exchange a patient summary — covering information such as allergies, 917 
current medications and significant history — together with electronic prescriptions that a 918 
traveller can have dispensed in another country, with imaging, laboratory results and discharge 919 
reports planned to follow.30,31,32 The personal data remains held nationally and is exchanged on 920 
demand between contact points, so that continuity of care is achieved without centralising 921 
records. The accompanying legal framework distinguishes the use of health data for direct care 922 
from its governed secondary use for research, policy and planning, each with its own access 923 
and oversight arrangements.33 924

Where the European infrastructure illustrates federated exchange of clinical content within a 928

Space and amending Directive 2011/24/EU and Regulation (EU) 2024/2847. It was published in the Official Journal on 5 March

exchange depends. WHO’s Global Digital Health Certification Network (GDHCN) is an openly 930 
governed trust network through which participating authorities verify the authenticity and 931 
provenance of verifiable health documents issued by one another — confirming, through a 932 
shared public-key infrastructure, that a document was genuinely issued by a trusted authority 933 
and has not been altered.34 It establishes trust without centralising data: the personal content of 934 
a document remains with the issuing authority, and the network conveys only the means to 935 
verify it. And it applies the same trust mechanism across many document types, keeping the 936 
trust layer separate from — and reusable across — the clinical content it secures, in the same 937 
way that, within a country, trust and transport are kept separate from the data they carry. 938 
 939 
For countries and regions designing cross-border exchange, several requirements follow: 940 
• A shared, internationally aligned patient summary specification, such as the International 941 
Patient Summary (IPS), should define the meaningful minimum exchanged for care.  942 
• Terminology and language translation services should allow a receiving clinician to 943 
interpret content in their own working language.  944 
• A cross-jurisdiction trust framework — mutual recognition of identities, credentials and 945 
digital signatures, underpinned by appropriate public-key infrastructure — shall establish 946 
that participants, and the data they exchange, can be trusted.  947 
• The legal basis and consent arrangements for cross-border processing shall be explicit.  948 
• These cross-border arrangements should build on foundational cross-border identity and 949 
trust DPI where it exists, extending it with the health-specific content and consent 950 
considerations rather than duplicating it. 951
