ARCHITECTURE 
PLACEMENT 
AND 
BOUNDARY 
WITH THE HMIS 
The Public Health Surveillance Platform (PHSP) sits in the business services layer 
of the DPI-H reference architecture. It is architecturally distinct from the HMIS in both 
function and focus. The HMIS aggregates routine health indicators from facility-level 
reporting to support programme monitoring and strategic planning. The PHSP 
supports the systematic detection, investigation, and coordinated response to public 
health threats through case-based, event-based, and indicator-based surveillance. 
The two components exchange data bidirectionally and are complementary; where 
their boundaries are unclear in a specific country context, countries should define 
them through their national health information architecture. There is no direct 
equivalent of the PHSP in  the OpenHIE architecture specification; the component 
draws on the international framework of Integrated Disease Surveillance and 
Response (IDSR), the WHO Event Information System, and the legal obligations 
established under the International Health Regulations 2005. 
 5 
1  WHAT IT IS 
 6 
The Public Health Surveillance Platform is a governed, shared application component for the systematic, 7 
ongoing collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of health data to detect, monitor, and respond 8 
to public health threats at local, national, and international levels. It supports both routine indicator -based 9 
surveillance, aggregated from health facility reporting and the Lifelong Health Record, and event -based 10 
surveillance, capturing signals from community reports, laboratory alerts, environmental monitoring, and 11 
other non-routine sources. Together, these modalities provide the analytical and operational foundation for 12 
early warning, outbreak detection, case investigation, and coordinated public health response. 13 
The PHSP draws on the shared data foundations of the DPI-H ecosystem — including the Client Registry, 14 
Health Facility Registry, Terminology Service, and Lifelong Health Record — to avoid parallel data 15 
collection and ensure that surveillance data is semantically consistent with clinical and administrative data 16 
across the health system. This integration with shared infrastructure is a defining architectural characteristic 17 
that distinguishes the PHSP in a DPI-H ecosystem from traditional public health surveillance systems, which 18 
typically operate as parallel infrastructure maintaining their own person registries, facility lists, and reporting 19 
pipelines independently of the clinical data ecosystem. By deriving surveillance information from data 20 
already captured at the point of care, the PHSP simultaneously reduces the reporting burden on health 21 
workers, improves the timeliness and completeness of surveillance data, and ensures that the picture 22 
surveillance generates is consistent with the clinical and administrative data on which the rest of the health 23 
system operates. 24 
A public health surveillance platform of this scope is more accurately described as an Electronic Integrated 25 
Disease Surveillance and Response (eIDSR) system in the terminology used by the WHO IDSR framework 26 
and the broader public health informatics community. Evidence from national eIDSR implementations 27 
suggests that well -governed electronic integrated surveillance systems can substantially improve 28 
surveillance completeness  and timeliness of case notification, with corresponding improvements in 29 
   
 
219 
outbreak detection and response capacity.60,61 The PHSP is the DPI-H reference architecture's expression 30 
of this eIDSR concept, positioned as shared digital infrastructure governed in the public interest and 31 
integrated with the broader health information ecosystem. 32 
 33 
 34 
2  WHY IT MATTERS FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES 
 35 
The ability to detect, respond to, and recover from disease outbreaks, climate -related health threats, and 36 
other public health emergencies depends on surveillance infrastructure that is continuously operating, not 37 
assembled in a crisis. The history of epidemic response is substantially a history of the consequences of 38 
surveillance systems that were too slow, too fragmented, or too dependent on manual processes to detect 39 
and communicate threats before they had spread beyond the point where early containment was possible. 40 
The difference between a contained outbreak and a public health emergency of international concern is 41 
frequently measured in days, and those days are determined in large part by the speed and reliability of the 42 
surveillance infrastructure that generates the first signal. 43 
In most health systems, surveillance infrastructure has been built in the same fragmented, programme -44 
specific way as other digital health investments. Disease -specific surveillance systems have been 45 
established for priority conditions, each with their own case definitions, reporting forms, data formats, and 46 
management arrangements. Laboratory information systems operate independently of clinical reporting 47 
systems. Community health worker reporting flows through channels that are disconnected from facility -48 
based surveillance. Environmental and climate-related health monitoring sits outside the health information 49 
architecture. The consequence is a surveillance landscape that is expensive to operate, difficult to integrate, 50 
and less able to detect cross -programme patterns and anomalies that signal emerging threats. This 51 
fragmentation has direct consequences for outbreak response: assembling a coherent picture from data 52 
held in multiple systems and reported through multiple channels takes time, and this is time an outbreak 53 
uses to spread. 54 
The challenge extends beyond communicable disease. Climate change is increasingly a determinant of 55 
health system performance, driving changes in disease distribution, intensifying heat -related illness, 56 
creating conditions for vector -borne disease emergence, and generating acute health crises through 57 
extreme weather events. Surveillance infrastructure limited to communicable disease reporting is not 58 
capable of detecting or responding to this broader range of threats. 59 
Evidence from national electronic IDSR implementations supports the value of investing in integrated digital 60 
surveillance infrastructure. Evaluations of eIDSR systems in multiple countries have demonstrated 61 
substantial improvements in reporting completeness, timeliness of case notification, and speed of outbreak 62 
detection and response following the transition from paper-based to electronic integrated surveillance.  63 
A governed Public Health Surveillance Platform addresses these failures, enabling: 64 
• Continuous, routine surveillance as the foundation of epidemic preparedness, so that the data 65 
infrastructure, reporting relationships, case definitions, and analytical capabilities required for outbreak 66 
detection are operational before an emergency occurs, rather than being assembled under crisis 67 
conditions when speed is most critical and capacity is most constrained. 68 
• Early detection of emerging threats through the application of configurable detection algorithms and 69 
statistical methods to routine surveillance data, identifying unusual patterns, clusters, and threshold 70 
exceedances that may signal the onset of an outbreak or other public health emergency before it 71 
becomes clinically apparent at the population level. 72

220 
• Integration of multiple surveillance modalities — combining routine indicator -based surveillance from 73 
health facilities, event -based surveillance from community and non -routine sources, laboratory -74 
confirmed diagnostic data, and environmental and climate-related health monitoring — into a coherent 75 
operational picture than any single-modality surveillance system can readily provide. 76 
• Elimination of parallel surveillance data collection by drawing on clinical data already held in the LHR, 77 
aggregate data from the HMIS, and person and facility references from the shared registries, reducing 78 
the reporting burden on health workers and facilities that would otherwise be required to submit the 79 
same data through multiple surveillance channels simultaneously. 80 
• Coordinated public health response through shared operational infrastructure within which investigation 81 
tasks, containment measures, resource deployment, and communication actions are planned, 82 
assigned, tracked, and reported, giving response teams a common operational picture. 83 
• Fulfilment of international reporting obligations, supporting the timely, accurate, and standardised 84 
reporting required under the International Health Regulations and other international surveillance 85 
frameworks. 86 
• Surveillance for climate -related health threats, extending the PHSP's scope beyond communicable 87 
disease to encompass environmental health monitoring, heat-related illness surveillance, vector habitat 88 
tracking, and the health consequences of extreme weather events. 89 
• Feedback into clinical care and decision support, ensuring that population-level surveillance signals — 90 
including antimicrobial resistance patterns, vaccine effectiveness data, and emerging pathogen 91 
characteristics — are available to the CDSE and HMIS to inform clinical guidance and programme 92 
management. 93 
The PHSP in a DPI -H ecosystem is architecturally distinct from traditional public health surveillance 94 
systems in one critical respect: it is designed to derive its data from shared infrastructure rather than to 95 
maintain parallel data collection channels that duplicate what the health system already captures. This 96 
reduces the burden of surveillance on health workers and facilities, improves the timeliness and 97 
completeness of surveillance data, and ensures that the picture surveillance generates is consistent with 98 
the clinical and administrative data on which the rest of the health system operates. It also means that the 99 
investment made in shared registries, the LHR, and the Terminology Service delivers surveillance value as 100 
well as clinical value, compounding the return on shared infrastructure across multiple health system 101 
functions simultaneously. 102 
 103

mechanisms, in compliance with the PHSP's obligations under the International Health Regulations 155 
2005. 156 
 157 
4  HOW IT CONNECTS 
 158 
The PHSP is a major consumer of shared data infrastructure and a primary contributor to international 159 
health security, with relationships spanning the full DPI -H ecosystem and extending to international 160 
surveillance frameworks. 161 
The Lifelong Health Record is the PHSP's primary source of person -level clinical data. Clinical data on 162 
notifiable conditions, laboratory results, diagnoses, and clinical presentations recorded in the LHR can 163 
populate surveillance case records, improving timeliness and completeness of surveillance reporting and 164 
reducing the burden on facilities simultaneously providing care and fulfilling surveillance obligations. The 165 
PHSP accesses LHR data through standardised query interfaces, subject to the consent and access 166 
governance frameworks that govern the LHR, and does not hold its own duplicate copy of person -level 167 
clinical data beyond what is required for case management and contact tracing. 168 
The Client Registry provides the verified person identity used to register and link surveillance cases, 169 
ensuring that cases reported from different facilities or through different channels are correctly attributed to 170 
the same individual and that duplicates are detected.  171 
   
 
222 
The Health Facility Registry provides authoritative references for reporting facilities, enabling attribution of 172 
cases and events to specific locations, aggregation at defined administrative levels, and geographic 173 
analysis of disease distribution. Facility attributes including location, type, and catchment population 174 
support the spatial targeting of response activities. 175 
The Terminology Service ensures that disease codes, pathogen identifiers, clinical findings, and other 176 
coded concepts used in surveillance case definitions are consistently interpreted across contributing 177 
systems. Surveillance depends on the consistent application of case definitions, and the Terminology 178 
Service provides the governed, authoritative coding infrastructure on which that consistency depends. The 179 
PHSP subscribes to Terminology Service updates to ensure case definitions remain aligned with current 180 
terminology versions. 181 
The LIMR provides the structural definitions that govern how surveillance case data, contact tracing 182 
records, and outbreak reports are organised and exchanged. Consistent data structures across surveillance 183 
programmes are a prerequisite for reliable case counting and epidemiological analysis.  184 
The PHSP and the HMIS are complementary but distinct. The PHSP contributes case -level and outbreak 185 
data to the HMIS, enriching the aggregate health information picture during public health events. The HMIS 186 
provides aggregate health indicators and baseline trend data to the PHSP, supplying the statistical 187 
baselines against which outbreak detection algorithms identify anomalies. Countries should coordinate the 188 
governance of the two components to prevent duplication and maintain consistency between the indicators 189 
each produces. 190 
The PHSP and the CDSE interact where surveillance intelligence should modify clinical recommendations 191 
at the point of care. Surveillance signals generated by the PHSP — including antimicrobial resistance 192 
patterns, vaccine effectiveness data, outbreak alerts, and emerging pathogen characteristics — can inform 193 
the review and updating of clinical decision support logic in the CDSE, ensuring point -of-care guidance 194 
reflects current epidemiological conditions. The CDSE can also support automated case classification and 195 
risk scoring logic that feeds back into the PHSP's surveillance functions. 196 
The Health Workforce Registry provides references for public health officers, surveillance coordinators, and 197 
response team members who access the PHSP, supporting role -based access controls. During outbreak 198 
response, the Health Workforce Registry would also provide information on workforce availability and 199 
credentials that supports the deployment of qualified personnel to response activities. 200 
International surveillance platforms and frameworks — including the WHO Integrated Data Platform, the 201 
WHO Event Information System, and the IHR reporting mechanisms — define the external exchange and 202 
reporting obligations that shape significant dimensions of the PHSP's functional and governance 203 
requirements. Countries should ensure that the PHSP's data standards, exchange protocols, and reporting 204 
workflows are aligned with these international frameworks from the outset, rather than treating international 205 
reporting as a function to be accommodated after the national architecture is established. 206 
Where general-purpose data exchange infrastructure exists at the foundational DPI level, the PHSP may 207 
leverage it to exchange surveillance alerts and notifications with non -health sector actors — including 208 
emergency management authorities, civil protection agencies, and environmental monitoring systems — 209 
supporting the cross-sectoral coordination that effective public health emergency response requires. The 210 
health-specific semantic and structural requirements of clinical surveillance data mean, however, that 211 
standards-based health interoperability infrastructure and the Terminology Service remain the primary 212 
exchange infrastructure for clinical data flows into and out of the PHSP. 213

GOVERNANCE 
Governance of the PHSP follows the cross-cutting governance framework in Section 
3.4 of the guidance document. Component-specific considerations include:  
(1) Institutional ownership and public health authority. Stewardship should be vested 
in the national public health authority with a clear legal mandate for communicable 
disease surveillance, outbreak response, and public health emergency management, 
grounded in national legislation. Ownership should not be fragmented across multiple 
programme-specific authorities, as the PHSP's value as shared infrastructure 
depends on governance that is coherent across all surveillance programmes and 
health system levels.  
(2) Legal framework for mandatory reporting and data use. Public health surveillance 
requires a legal framework explicitly authorising the collection and use of identifiable 
personal health data without individual consent in defined public health 
circumstances, while establishing clear limits on the purposes for which that authority 
may be exercised. The legal basis for mandatory case reporting, contact tracing data 
retention, international sharing, and individual rights in relation to surveillance data 
should be publicly accessible, regularly reviewed, and aligned with the national data 
protection framework governing other DPI-H components.  
(3) Privacy and consent governance. Countries should establish clear policies on the 
minimum identifiable data required for each surveillance function, retention periods 
for case and contact tracing records, conditions under which surveillance data may 
be de-identified for secondary use, and individual rights in relation to data held in the 
PHSP. Emergency access provisions that override normal consent requirements 
should be explicitly defined, time-limited, and subject to audit.  
(4) Outbreak declaration and communication governance. Countries should establish 
clear protocols for who has authority to declare a public health emergency, at what 
threshold, through what process, and with what obligations for public communication 
and in ternational notification. The PHSP provides the technical infrastructure; 
governance determines the decision rights and accountability structures.  
(5) Event -based surveillance governance. Countries should establish policies on 
which sources of event -based signals are monitored, how signals are triaged and 
verified before triggering formal action, how unverified signals are managed, and how 
source confidentiality is protected where relevant.

(6) IHR compliance governance. Countries should ensure that the PHSP's data 
standards and reporting workflows are aligned with IHR requirements from the outset, 
that designated national focal points have the access and authority to submit required 
notifications, and that the PHSP supports the audit trail required to demonstrate IHR 
compliance.  
(7) Laboratory network governance. Countries should define the reporting obligations 
of public and private laboratories, the data standards through which laboratory results 
flow into the PHSP, turnaround time requirements for public health-critical diagnostic 
testing, and governance of national reference laboratory functions.  
(8) Climate and environmental health surveillance governance. Countries should 
establish cross -sectoral governance arrangements bringing together health 
authorities, environmental agencies, meteorological services, and emergency 
management bodies to define  surveillance indicators, data sharing protocols, and 
response coordination mechanisms for climate -related health threats — formalised 
before an emergency occurs.  
(9) Data quality and completeness governance. The reliability of outbreak detection 
depends directly on the completeness and timeliness of surveillance data 
submissions from reporting sites. Countries should establish minimum reporting 
standards — including defined reporting frequencies, completeness thresholds, and 
timeliness requirements — and create accountability mechanisms through which 
persistent reporting failures are escalated and addressed. Data quality governance 
for surveillance should be treated as an ongoing supervisory responsibility with clear 
lines of accountability from facility-level reporters through district surveillance officers 
to national public health authorities, rather than delegated solely to technical quality 
assurance functions. 
(10) After-action review and continuous improvement. Countries should establish a 
formal after-action review process triggered by defined events, following a structured 
methodology, producing documented findings, and tracking implementation of 
recommendations.  
(11) Sustainability and financing. Public health surveillance is a continuous 
operational requirement, not a project activity. Countries should avoid models 
financed primarily through emergency response funding or donor -specific project 
cycles. Sustainable financing requires the PHSP to be recognised as core national 
public health infrastructure within national health budgets.
