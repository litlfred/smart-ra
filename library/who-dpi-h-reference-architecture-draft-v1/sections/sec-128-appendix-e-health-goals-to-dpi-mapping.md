1 Build Trusted Data Foundations 225 
 226 
Goal: core health data is captured once and reused reliably across programmes, services, and 227 
levels of care. 228 
 229 
What the health system needs to be able to do: the health system needs authoritative, 230 
uniquely identified reference data — who people are, who provides care, where, with what 231 
products, and under what terms — held once and made available to every application 232 
component that needs it, rather than re-collected and reconciled in each. It needs that data to 233 
be well governed, current, and trustworthy, so that the systems built upon it can rely on it 234 
without duplicating or re-verifying it. 235 
 236 
Unlike the goals that follow, this one has no mapping of its own. It is the foundation the other six 237 
draw on. Each of those mappings traces back to the same shared components — the client, 238 
health facility, and health workforce registries, the terminology service, the product registry, and 239 
the lifelong health record — and the recurrence of those components across goal after goal is 240 
the "capture once, use many times" principle made visible. The composition of that foundation, 241 
the minimum a country puts in place first, and how it matures over time are set out in the 242 
REDDHI framework in Section 2.2; the spreadsheets in this appendix show that foundation 243 
being reused, goal by goal. 244 
 245 
 246 
2 Support a Capable, Well-Distributed Health Workforce 247 
 248 
Goal: a health workforce whose members are individually identifiable and verifiable, deployed 249 
where they are needed, paid reliably, and supported to maintain and extend their competencies 250 
across the course of their careers. 251 
 252 
What the health system needs to be able to do: the system needs to know who its health 253 
workers are and what each is qualified and authorised to do, holding an authoritative record of 254 
identity, occupational classification, professional registration, and licensing status that clinical, 255 
administrative, financing, and regulatory systems can consistently rely on. It needs to see where 256 
workers are deployed and where shortages persist, so that staffing can be planned against 257 
population need rather than inferred from incomplete or paper-based records. And it needs to 258 
pay workers reliably, and to track the education, credentialing, and supervision through which 259 
competence is established and renewed over time. 260 
 261 
How to read the mapping: the spreadsheet that follows traces each capability from the goal 262 
through stakeholder value, business capability, and application service to the DPI-H 263 
components and foundational-DPI dependencies that support it, and notes where each 264 
component is reused by other goals. Its most significant shared components are the Health 265 
   
 
237 
Workforce Registry it centres on — itself a core foundational registry that other health goals also 266 
rely on — supported by the terminology service for occupational and qualification coding and 267 
the facility registry for linking workers to their sites of practice and mapping deployment, all 268 
resting on foundational-DPI identity, trust, payments, and single sign-on services. The workforce 269 
goal introduces no new DPI-H component; the operational systems that act on the registry — 270 
digital payroll, human-resource information systems, and learning-management and training-271 
tracking applications — sit outside DPI-H and consume it rather than being defined by it. 272 
 273

3 Ensure Quality and Continuity of Care 276 
 277 
Goal: care that is informed by a person's full health history, guided by current evidence at the 278 
point of care, and coordinated across every provider, setting, and episode a person moves 279 
through. 280 
 281 
What the health system needs to be able to do: the system needs to assemble a person's 282 
longitudinal record from the many places care is given and present it as a single coherent view, 283 
so that each encounter builds on what came before rather than starting afresh. It needs to make 284 
current, evidence-based protocols and decision support available to health workers as they 285 
make decisions, and to support the safe delegation of clinical tasks across cadres according to 286 
scope of practice. And it needs to coordinate care over time — referrals, transitions between 287 
settings, shared care plans, and follow-up — while tracking adherence and quality so that gaps 288 
and duplication can be seen and corrected. 289 
 290 
How to read the mapping: the spreadsheet that follows traces each capability from the goal 291 
through stakeholder value, business capability, and application service to the DPI-H 292 
components and foundational-DPI dependencies that support it, and notes where each 293 
component is reused by other goals. Despite its breadth, the goal rests very largely on shared 294 
infrastructure other goals already require — the client registry to resolve a single patient identity 295 
across sources, the health workforce and facility registries to attribute care to verified providers 296 
and sites, the terminology service to keep clinical meaning consistent, and the lifelong health 297 
record as the shared longitudinal store every provider reads from and writes to. The genuinely 298 
new DPI-H component the goal introduces is the Clinical Decision Support Engine, which 299 
delivers context-aware, guideline-based recommendations at the point of care and has no direct 300 
equivalent in earlier reference architectures. The operational systems that carry out the work — 301 
point-of-care clinical applications, care-coordination and referral tools, electronic prescribing, 302 
laboratory and imaging systems — consume these shared components rather than being 303 
defined by DPI-H. 304

4 Establish Trusted Personal Health Records 309 
   
 
238 
 310 
Goal: every person has a verifiable digital health record that they can access and control, and 311 
that authorised providers can rely on across the places they seek care. 312 
 313 
What the health system needs to be able to do: the system needs to resolve each person to 314 
a single, verifiable identity and to assemble their longitudinal record so that it can be reached 315 
wherever care is given. It needs to let people see and govern who accesses their information, 316 
through consent that can be granted, recorded, and withdrawn. And it needs to assure the 317 
authenticity and integrity of records and of the people and institutions that contribute to them, so 318 
that a record can be trusted by a provider who did not create it. 319 
 320 
How to read the mapping: the spreadsheet that follows traces each capability from the goal 321 
through stakeholder value, business capability, and application service to the DPI-H 322 
components and foundational-DPI dependencies that support it, and notes where each 323 
component is reused by other goals. This goal is distinctive in introducing no new DPI-H 324 
component of its own: it is the goal the foundational shared-data layer exists to serve, realised 325 
through the client registry and the lifelong health record, supported by the workforce and facility 326 
registries for accountable, verified contribution and by the terminology service for consistent 327 
meaning, and resting on foundational-DPI trust services together with the cross-cutting consent 328 
and security properties addressed elsewhere in this guidance. The patient-facing applications 329 
through which people view and manage their records consume this foundation rather than being 330 
defined by DPI-H. 331

5 Optimize Supply Chain Management 336 
 337 
Goal: safe health products reach the people who need them, when and where they are needed, 338 
through a supply chain that is visible end to end and able to adapt when demand shifts. 339 
 340 
What the health system needs to be able to do: the system needs to forecast demand and 341 
plan supply against budgets and programme priorities, and to see stock levels and product 342 
movement from source to point of use. It needs to identify products, locations, suppliers, and 343 
individual batches consistently, so that an item can be traced through ordering, storage, 344 
transport, and dispensing, and recalled or removed when needs arise. And it needs to connect 345 
these flows to the rest of the health system — to facilities, to financing, and to the people who 346 
ultimately receive the products. 347 
 348 
How to read the mapping: the spreadsheet that follows traces each capability from the goal 349 
through stakeholder value, business capability, and application service to the DPI-H 350 
components and foundational-DPI dependencies that support it, and notes where each 351 
component is reused by other goals. The goal leans on shared infrastructure other goals 352 
already require — the health facility registry to locate every point in the network, the terminology 353 
   
 
239 
service to standardise product and service codes, and the client registry where dispensing is 354 
traced to the individual — while the components specific to this domain are two reference 355 
registries: a Product Registry that lets products be identified and traced consistently across the 356 
network, and a Supplier Registry that records provenance and supplier accountability. The 357 
operational systems that run the supply chain — forecasting, order, warehouse, procurement, 358 
transport, and dispensing applications, including the tracking of individual batches and serial 359 
numbers — consume these shared registries rather than being defined by DPI-H. 360

6 Advance Efficient and Equitable Health Financing 364 
 365 
The method is illustrated in full for this goal in the worked example in Section 2.4.2. The 366 
spreadsheet below provides the complete mapping — goal to stakeholder value to capability to 367 
application service to component — including the public financial management, revenue, 368 
pooling, purchasing, benefits design, and safeguarding sub-functions in detail. 369

 372 
7 Strengthen Climate and Epidemic Resilience 373 
 374 
Goal: anticipate epidemic and climate-related health threats early enough to act, and mount a 375 
coordinated response when they arrive. 376 
 377 
What the health system needs to be able to do: the system needs to detect health events 378 
early — through case reporting, syndromic and event-based surveillance, and adverse-event 379 
and safety reporting — and to link those signals to verified people, providers, and places so that 380 
cases can be confirmed, de-duplicated, and located. It needs to turn signals into assessed risk 381 
and timely warning, increasingly by drawing weather, climate, and environmental data alongside 382 
health data so that climate-sensitive threats can be anticipated rather than only observed. And it 383 
needs to coordinate the response and share information across providers and, where required, 384 
across borders. 385 
 386 
How to read the mapping: the spreadsheet that follows traces each capability from the goal 387 
through stakeholder value, business capability, and application service to the DPI-H 388 
components and foundational-DPI dependencies that support it, and notes where each 389 
component is reused by other goals. The goal rests heavily on shared infrastructure other goals 390 
already require — the client registry to link and de-duplicate cases, the health workforce registry 391 
to authenticate reporters, the health facility registry to geolocate events and map outbreaks, the 392 
terminology service for standardised disease and event coding, the product registry as the 393 
authoritative product reference for adverse-event and safety reporting, and the health 394 
management information system for aggregation and secondary use. Its distinctive DPI-H 395 
component is the public health surveillance platform; and, distinctively among the seven goals, 396 
its climate dimension draws on a foundational-DPI weather, climate, and environment data 397 
   
 
240 
capability that sits outside the health sector and is reached through the same interoperability 398 
that connects the rest of the architecture. The operational systems that do the work — case-399 
reporting, adverse-event, outbreak-management, and analytics applications, together with the 400 
alerting services that deliver warnings to health workers — consume these components rather 401 
than being defined by DPI-H. 402
