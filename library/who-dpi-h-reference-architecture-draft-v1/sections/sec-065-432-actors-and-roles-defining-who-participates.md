Data models describe the information a system holds; they do not, on their own, describe who 286 
acts on that information. An implementable specification also defines the actors — both human 287 
and system — that participate in each transaction, and the roles they play. This matters for 288 
several reasons that recur across DPI-H components: access to data and functions has to be 289 
granted by role; actions recorded in a shared record have to be attributed to an identifiable 290 
actor; workflows have to express which actor performs each step; and the capability statements 291 
that govern conformance are written from the perspective of a defined actor. 292 
WHO SMART Guidelines offer a worked example of this practice.37 The operational layer — the 293 
digital adaptation kit — defines a set of generic personas: depersonalised, context-free 294 
descriptions of the human and system actors involved in delivering a health service, set out 295 
alongside the data elements, workflows, and decision logic for a given domain. In the 296 
corresponding implementation guide, these personas are expressed as computable actor 297 
definitions against which workflows, capability statements, and access rules are anchored. The 298 
same discipline applies to shared infrastructure. For each DPI-H component, countries should 299 
define the minimum set of actors and roles that participate in its transactions — for a registry, for 300 
example, the registrant, the verifying authority, and the consuming system — and govern these 301 
role schemas through the same mechanisms used for data models and terminology. Defining 302 
 
37WHO SMART Guidelines (Standards-based, Machine-readable, Adaptive, Requirements-based, Testable). The digital adaptation 
kit (L2) defines generic personas among its standardised components, which are represented as computable actor definitions in the 
corresponding FHIR implementation guide (L3). WHO SMART guidelines: optimising country-level use of guideline

actors explicitly, and reusing a common set across components, keeps access control, 303 
attribution, and workflow consistent across the ecosystem rather than re-invented for each 304 
system. 305
