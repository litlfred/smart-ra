Each construct is bound to one ArchiMate element type. Section 3.1 establishes the core of the 992 
modelling language: the Application Component and Application Service element types, 993 
together with the four structural relationships — Realises, Composes, Serves, Accesses — that 994 
carry most of the model. Describing conformance and testing calls for a small, self-contained 995 
extension to that core — two further element types and two further relationships, used only in 996 
modelling behaviour and its evaluation — which this section introduces where they are needed 997 
and summarises in Table 3.7.1. 998

Type What it represents Example 
Application 
Interaction 
(element) 
Collective application behaviour 
performed by two or more 
components 
A transaction such as Provide and Register 
between a Document Source and a Document 
Repository 
Application

element to the behaviour it 
performs 
An actor performs the interaction it takes part in; 
a component performs its function 
Triggering 
(relationship) 
A causal "leads to" between 
behaviours 
A user's create-and-submit action triggers the 
transaction 
 1002 
These constructs extend the section 3.1 palette for the purposes of conformance and testing. 1003 
The additions are: 1004 
• Application Interaction and Application Function — the two element types above; 1005 
• Assignment and Triggering — the two relationship types above. (Realisation, already 1006 
declared, also carries the country-to-reference mapping.) 1007 
 1008 
A further set — Application Interface, Business Process, Business Role, and 1009 
Requirement/Constraint — is needed only by the UI-testing and explicit-criteria views and 1010 
would be added when those views are adopted. The verdict of an evaluation is left implicit for 1011 
now; in ArchiMate it would be recorded as an Assessment.  1012 
 1013 
Actors as Application Components 1014 
 1015 
An actor is an abstract information-processing role — for example a Document Source or a 1016 
Patient Demographics Consumer. It names a set of responsibilities, independently of any 1017 
product that fulfils them. An actor is modelled as an Application Component. A concrete 1018 
system — a vendor product, a national service — is also an Application Component, bound to 1019 
the actor by a realisation relationship: the system realises the actor. One system may realise 1020 
several actors; one actor may be realised by many systems. 1021 
 1022 
Offered and required Application Services 1023 
 1024 
What an actor does is expressed as Application Services, related to the actor by two different 1025 
relationship types according to whether the service is offered or required: 1026 
• A service the actor offers is one it realises — a service it exposes, which in turn serves 1027 
its consumers. This is the responder role in an interaction. 1028 
• A service the actor requires is one that serves the actor — a capability it depends on. 1029 
This is the initiator role in an interaction. 1030 
A component thus realises the services it provides and is served by the services it consumes; it 1031 
does not serve its own service. These offered and required services are the contractually 1032 
meaningful surface of the actor — the externally observable behaviour against which 1033 
conformance is declared. 1034 
 1035 
Each actor–service association additionally carries a support qualifier: the service may be 1036 
mandatory or optional for that actor. A mandatory service is supported by any system claiming 1037 
the actor; an optional service may be supported or not, and where it is, behaves as specified. 1038 
This is independent of the offered/required direction, and corresponds to the required/optional 1039 
(R/O) designation an IHE profile gives each transaction. ArchiMate has no native qualifier for it, 1040 
   
 
81 
so it is recorded as a Property on the serving relationship, or — where normative and testable 1041 
— as a motivation-layer Constraint. (Note the two senses of "required": a required service is 1042 
one the actor depends on; a mandatory service is one whose support is obligatory. This 1043 
document reserves offered/required for the direction and mandatory/optional for support.) 1044 
 1045 
Interactions and transactions 1046 
 1047 
The architecture models the exchange between two actors as an Application Interaction — 1048 
collective application behaviour performed by two or more cooperating components. The 1049 
interaction is the shared behaviour the initiator and responder jointly perform; each actor owns 1050 
its side, and each is assigned to the interaction. (Application Interaction is a new element 1051 
type being added to the reference architecture, together with the Assignment relationship it 1052 
depends on — see 3.7.2 – The model, above.) 1053 
 1054 
A transaction — a fully specified machine-to-machine protocol exchange, with defined trigger 1055 
events, message semantics, and expected actions — is one kind of Application Interaction: its 1056 
precise, specifiable subset. The architecture works at the broader level of interaction, because 1057 
the same service is often reached by interactions that are not machine-to-machine transactions 1058 
(see Multiple access patterns to a single service) and by exchanges not yet specified to 1059 
transaction level. Where an interaction is specified as a transaction, that specification may be 1060 
supplied by a framework such as IHE rather than restated here (see Alignment with IHE 1061 
profiles). 1062 
 1063 
Crucially, the interaction is not the unit of conformance. It describes an exchange — useful 1064 
for documentation, sequence diagrams, and message specification — but a product is not 1065 
certified as "conformant to an interaction" in isolation; it is certified as correctly playing an actor's 1066 
role in that interaction. Figure 3.7.1 brings these pieces together. 1067 
 1068 
   
 
82 
1069 
Figure 3.7.1. A system realising an actor with its offered and required services, and the two actors 1070 
connected by a transaction. The concrete system (Vendor EHR Product) realises the Document Source 1071 
actor; the actor realises the service it offers (Provide Documents) and is served by the service it requires; 1072 
and both actors are assigned to the Provide and Register [ITI-41] interaction, each owning its side. A 1073 
component realises the services it provides and is served by the services it consumes — it does not serve 1074 
its own service. 1075 
 1076 
Multiple access patterns to a single service 1077 
 1078 
The architecture treats the Application Service as the stable unit of capability and the 1079 
Application Interaction as one way of reaching it. A single service can be reached through more 1080 
than one interaction — a machine-to-machine transaction is one access pattern; a human-1081 
initiated UI workflow is another — and both reach the same Application Service. This matters for 1082 
conformance: conformance is asserted about the service the component provides, not about 1083 
any one channel through which it is invoked. 1084 
 1085 
Conformance at the Application Component level 1086 
 1087 
Conformance is a statement about a system, expressed in terms of the actors it claims to 1088 
realise and the options it supports: 1089 
 1090 
Conformance is the assertion that a given Application Component correctly realises the 1091 
Application Services associated with a named actor role — as initiator, as responder, or 1092 
both. 1093 
 1094 
It follows that: 1095 
1. The unit of conformance is the Application Component (the system realising the 1096 
actor), not the Application Interaction. 1097 
   
 
83 
2. Conformance is role-directional. A system may conform as the responder without 1098 
conforming as the initiator, and vice versa, because these are distinct services. 1099 
3. Testing exercises one side of an interaction at a time. The component under test 1100 
plays one actor role; a simulator — itself an Application Component realising the 1101 
opposite actor — plays the other side. The test verifies that the system-under-test's 1102 
services behave as specified. 1103 
4. The support qualifier determines what is tested. Every mandatory service is tested; 1104 
an optional service is tested only where the system declares support for it. 1105 
 1106 
 1107 
Figure 3.7.2 shows this arrangement, including the alternative of driving the test through the 1108 
system's user interface. 1109 
1110 
Figure 3.7.2. Conformance testing view. The System Under Test realises one actor role (here Document 1111 
Source, the initiator) while a Simulator realises the opposite actor (Document Repository); both are 1112 
assigned to the Provide and Register [ITI-41] interaction, so the test exercises one side at a time. The 1113 
same system can also be driven through its UI: a Test Operator who creates and submits a document 1114 
through the Document Capture UI triggers the same transaction — verifying the system end-to-end, as a 1115 
user would, rather than by invoking the machine interface directly. 1116
