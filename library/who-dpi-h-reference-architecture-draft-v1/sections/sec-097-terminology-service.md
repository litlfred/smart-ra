DPI-H Foundational Layer  ·  Shared Data Layer  ·  Semantic Governance Infrastructure   3

ARCHITECTURE 
PLACEMENT 
AND 
RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE LIMR 
The Terminology Service (TS) sits in the shared data layer of the DPI-H foundational 
infrastructure, alongside the Logical Information Model Repository (LIMR), the Core 
Registries for Health and the Lifelong Health Record. It is a cross-cutting component: 
virtually every DPI -H component and every point -of-care system that exchanges 
health data depends on the TS for the consistent meaning of the coded values it 
uses. Together, the TS and the LIMR constitute the semantic governance 
infrastructure of the DPI -H ecosystem. The TS manages meaning — what coded 
concepts represent, how they relate to each other, and what values are permitted in 
a given field. The LIMR manages structure — what fields exist, what data types they 
hold, what cardinalities apply, and whic h value sets from the TS bind to them. 
Neither is sufficient without the other. For example, the TS does not know about 
cardinality or field optionality and the LIMR does not know what a code means. Both 
depend on the other, and changes in either component  can affect the other — a 
relationship that requires coordinated governance.

1  WHAT IT IS 
 6 
The Terminology Service is a governed, publicly accessible service that manages, publishes, and provides 7 
access to the standardised terminologies, code systems, value sets, and concept maps used across the 8 
digital health ecosystem. It hosts both internationally recognised terminologies — such as ICD -11, 9 
SNOMED CT (and SNOMED GPS), LOINC, International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC), Anatomical 10 
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC), and International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) — 11 
and nationally or locally defined code systems and value sets, exposing them through standards -based 12 
APIs that enable consuming systems to validate codes, expand value sets, look up concept properties, and 13 
translate between code systems. It provides the meaning layer of the digital health ecosystem, 14 
complementing the structural definitions held in the LIMR. 15 
An important distinction in the DPI-H context is the difference between a Terminology Service deployed at 16 
facility or programme level — which provides operational terminology capabilities for local use — and the 17 
national Terminology Service, which functions as semantic governance infrastructure for the whole country. 18 
The national TS is not just a technical service; it is the authoritative institutional source for what coded 19 
concepts mean across the health system, managing the lifecycle of terminologies from international 20 
adoption through national extension to local use, and governing the change processes that ensure updates 21 
are made consistently and transparently. This governance function is what distinguishes the national TS 22 
from a locally deployed terminology tool, and it is the capability the DPI -H reference architecture is 23 
describing when it specifies the TS as a foundational component. 24 
The TS is not limited to widely used clinical terminologies. It equally serves the need for locally defined 25 
code systems — including local laboratory codes, national drug codes, local procedure classifications, and 26 
programme-specific indicator codes — where no international standard yet covers the relevant clinical or 27 
administrative domain. Supporting local and national code systems, and governing the relationships 28 
between local codes and their international equivalents through concept maps, is as important a function 29 
of the national TS as managing internationally adopted terminologies. 30 
 31 
2  WHY IT MATTERS FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES 
   
 
165 
 32 
Health data exchange is only meaningful if the parties exchanging data share a common understanding of 33 
what each coded value represents. Without a centrally governed source of terminologies and value sets, 34 
every digital system tends to maintain its own local code lists. Digital systems accumulate local copies of 35 
code systems that diverge over time as updates are applied inconsistently; the same clinical concept 36 
receives different codes in different facilities; and aggregate data cannot be reliably compared across 37 
programmes, facilities, or time periods. The consequence is health information that is syntactically 38 
exchangeable but semantically incomparable — a health system that can move data between systems but 39 
cannot reliably understand what it means once it arrives. 40 
The incentives that produce this problem are strong. Individual systems have limited visibility of or interest 41 
in how their local code choices affect other systems' ability to interpret the same data. Without a shared 42 
infrastructure that makes the semantic consistent coding available as a service, the path of least resistance 43 
is to define codes locally and map to standards only when forced to by specific exchange requirements. A 44 
national Terminology Service makes the consistent choice the easy choice: consuming systems query the 45 
TS rather than maintaining their own code lists, and the meaning of coded values is determined once, 46 
centrally, rather than being independently interpreted by each consuming system. 47 
The governance dimension is equally important. International terminology standards — SNOMED CT/GPS, 48 
ICD-11, LOINC — are updated regularly. National extensions to those standards, and national value sets 49 
built on them, require expert clinical and informatics review before changes are adopted. Without 50 
governance infrastructure, changes to international standards propagate unevenly into national 51 
implementations, creating a patchwork of systems running different versions of the same terminology and 52 
unable to reliably compare data across the versions. The TS is the institutional mechanism through which 53 
this change is managed, reviewed, versioned and disseminated in a controlled and traceable way. 54 
When a governed Terminology Service is in place, there are potential cumulative effects on health 55 
outcomes: 56 
• Clinicians and health systems can act on data that means the same thing across facilities, 57 
programmes, and borders — improving the reliability of clinical decisions, the accuracy of disease 58 
surveillance, and the integrity of the population -level information that guides resource allocation 59 
and health policy.  60 
• Digital systems no longer need to maintain their own local copies of code systems and value sets, 61 
reducing duplicated effort and the risk of divergence that undermines data comparability over time. 62 
• Compliance with licensing obligations for proprietary terminologies (such as SNOMED CT) is 63 
achieved through a single managed point of access rather than uncontrolled local copies, lowering 64 
the barrier to adoption of international standards and improving the quality and consistency of 65 
coded clinical data across the ecosystem. 66 
 67 
3  CORE ATTRIBUTES 
 68 
– Code system management. Storage and lifecycle management of code systems — including 69 
their concepts, designations, properties, hierarchical relationships, and versions — covering both 70 
internationally recognised terminologies and locally or nationally defined code systems. Local 71 
modifications of international terminologies, national extensions of SNOMED CT/GPS or ICD, and 72 
locally defined procedure or product codes are as important a scope of management as the 73 
international standards themselves. 74 
– Value set management. Definition, storage, and publication of value sets using both intensional 75 
(rule-based selection of concepts from a code system) and extensional (explicitly enumerated list 76 
of codes) definitions, with full versioning and lifecycle states, enabling consuming systems to 77 
retrieve the exact set of permitted values for a given data element at any given point in time. 78 
– Concept map management. Definition and publication of mappings between concepts in different 79 
code systems — establishing equivalence, broader-than, narrower-than, and related-to 80 
   
 
166 
relationships — enabling translation between terminologies and crosswalk between local and 81 
international coding schemes. 82 
– Standards-based runtime terminology services. Exposure of operations conformant to 83 
recognised terminology service specifications — including code validation, value set expansion, 84 
concept lookup, subsumption testing, and code translation — through machine-readable APIs, 85 
supporting both design-time configuration and runtime clinical and administrative transactions. 86 
– Multilingual support. Management of language-specific designations and translations for 87 
concepts, enabling consuming systems to display terms in the language appropriate to users and 88 
patients across the country, and supporting the addition of national language translations to 89 
internationally defined code systems. 90 
– Governance workflow and access control. Role-based access supporting editorial workflows — 91 
drafting, peer review, clinical validation, technical quality assurance, publication, and retirement — 92 
with full audit trails and provenance tracking, ensuring that terminology content is reviewed by 93 
authorised stewards with clinical and domain expertise before publication. 94 
– Licensing management. Enforcement of licensing terms and access restrictions associated with 95 
proprietary terminologies, ensuring that consuming systems and users access content in 96 
compliance with applicable licence conditions, and providing a single managed point of access that 97 
satisfies licence compliance obligations rather than requiring each consuming system to hold its 98 
own licence. 99 
– Federation and alignment with international sources. Synchronisation with or referencing of 100 
content published by international terminology authorities — including SNOMED International, 101 
WHO-FIC, and Regenstrief — enabling national extensions of globally curated content and 102 
establishing feedback mechanisms through which local change requests are submitted to global 103 
standards development organisations. 104 
 105 
4  HOW IT CONNECTS 
 106 
The Terminology Service has a dependency relationship with virtually every component in the DPI -H 107 
ecosystem that stores, exchanges, or analyses coded health data. It is the semantic anchor that gives 108 
meaning to the codes used across the ecosystem, and its availability and reliability are prerequisites for the 109 
meaningful operation of all components that depend on it. 110 
The relationship with the Logical Information Model Repository  is the most architecturally significant 111 
connection. The LIMR defines the structure of health data objects — what fields exist, what their 112 
cardinalities are, what data types they use. The TS defines the meaning of the coded values that populate 113 
those fields. Value set bindings declared in LIMR models reference value sets held in the TS, creating a 114 
bidirectional dependency: the LIMR depends on the TS to hold and serve the value sets it binds to, and 115 
changes in the TS — particularly the deprecation or restructuring of value sets — can affect the logical 116 
models in the LIMR that bind to them. This dependency must be managed through coordinated governance 117 
rather than unilateral update by either component. 118 
The Lifelong Health Record  and the health information exchange infrastructure depend on the TS to 119 
ensure that clinical data contributed from heterogeneous source systems carries consistent meaning when 120 
stored and exchanged. A coded diagnosis contributed by one system should mean the same thing when 121 
retrieved by another, and the TS is the authoritative reference that mediates this consistency.  122 
The Computable Decision Support Engine  resolves clinical concepts referenced in its decision logic 123 
against the TS, ensuring that rules operate on correctly coded data regardless of which source system 124 
contributed it. Changes in the TS — including the deprecation of codes used in clinical rules — should 125 
trigger impact analysis in the CDSE to ensure decision logic remains valid. 126 
The HMIS, the PHSP , and all analytical and reporting functions depend on the TS for semantic 127 
comparability of data drawn from multiple source systems. Aggregate indicators, case classifications, and 128 
cross-programme analyses are only reliable if the underlying data uses consistent codes; the TS is the 129 
infrastructure that makes that consistency achievable.  130 
   
 
167 
The Product Registry uses the TS for product classification codes and all other Core Registries for Health 131 
use the TS for the controlled vocabularies governing coded attributes in their minimum datasets. 132 
 133 
5  FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
 134 
Requirements are grouped by business process and draw on the OpenHIE Terminology Service 135 
specification (TSWF -1 to TSWF -8; TSF -1 to TSF -13) and the IHE Infrastructure Technical Framework 136 
Supplement on Sharing Value Sets, Codes, and Maps (SVCM). The DPI-H reference architecture extends 137 
OpenHIE in the following principal respects: versioning of code systems and value sets is elevated from 138 
Recommendation to Required; governance workflow is made an explicit requirement; licensing 139 
management, multilingual support, search and discovery, subscription and notification, and LIMR 140 
integration are added; and standards neutrality is maintained — FHIR is referenced as the recommended 141 
but not the only conformant implementation path. 142

GOVERNANCE 
Governance of the Terminology Service follows the cross -cutting governance 
framework in Section 3.4 of the guidance document. Component -specific 
considerations include:  
(1) Institutional ownership. Stewardship should be vested in a national health authority 
or a delegated standards body with a mandate spanning all health programmes and 
domains, not in a single vendor, project, or programme. The national TS is shared 
infrastructure and should be governed in the public interest.  
(2) Multi -disciplinary governance. Terminology governance requires active 
participation of clinical and public health domain experts, not only informaticians, to 
ensure that national value sets reflect local clinical practice, epidemiology, and 
reporting n eeds. Governance committees should include clinicians, public health 
professionals, pharmacists, and community health specialists alongside technical 
terminology experts.  
(3) Content lifecycle management. A clear content lifecycle — draft, review, approved, 
published, deprecated, retired — with explicit policies on backwards compatibility and 
version pinning is essential. Countries should define the minimum lead time for 
deprecating a code that is in active use in clinical systems, and the mechanism 
through which affected systems are notified.  
(4) Licensing obligations. Licensing of proprietary terminologies, notably SNOMED 
CT, should be planned as an institutional commitment including national member fees 
where applicable. The TS governance framework should define how licence 
compliance is moni tored, how access credentials are managed for individual 
consuming systems, and what happens when a consumer's licence lapses.  
(5) International coordination. The Terminology Service governance framework 
should establish processes for monitoring upstream releases from international 
standards development organisations, for reviewing and testing new releases before 
national adoption, for managing the transition period during which multiple versions 
may be in active use, and for submitting local change requests and feedback to 
international bodies.  
(6) Relationship with Semantic Governance Infrastructure. The TS is a component of 
the broader semantic governance infrastructure that also includes the LIMR. 
Governance of the two components should be coordinated rather than managed in 
isolation, particul arly regarding change management that crosses the boundary 
between terminology content and structural model definitions.
