The same structure makes two further things checkable: whether the architecture's goals are 1173 
being met, and whether a country's architecture adopts the reference. Both reuse constructs 1174 
already introduced, shifted to the appropriate elements. 1175 
 1176 
Validating goals 1177 
 1178 
A goal is validated in the same way as a component, with the parts shifted up to the motivation 1179 
layer. A goal carries its criteria as Outcomes — measurable results that, when achieved, signal 1180 
it (an Outcome realises the Goal it satisfies). Where a component is checked against the 1181 
Requirements its services are expected to satisfy, a goal is checked against its Outcomes; 1182 
both checks yield the same kind of verdict. 1183 
 1184 
The criterion is the Outcome (or a Requirement); the mechanism that checks it — an indicator 1185 
or measure — is modelled, where it needs to be shown, as a behaviour (an Application Function 1186 
or Business Process) that evaluates the outcome, just as a conformance test is the behaviour 1187 
that evaluates a component. The verdict of that check — whether the criterion is met — is left 1188 
implicit for now: it is not modelled as a distinct element. (ArchiMate has no "control" type; the 1189 
verdict would naturally be recorded as an Assessment if the model is later made to carry 1190 
evaluation results explicitly.) The pattern is the same at both levels — criterion → evaluating 1191 
mechanism → (implicit) verdict — whether the criterion is a service Requirement or a goal 1192 
Outcome. 1193 
 1194 
Evaluating adoption by mapping 1195 
 1196 
When a country expresses its architecture in the same formal language, adoption becomes 1197 
measurable by mapping each country element to the reference element it corresponds to. The 1198 
mapping is a realisation relationship — a country component realises a reference component 1199 
(or actor) — the very relationship already used for "a system realises an actor", now applied 1200 
between a country's architecture and the reference. 1201 
 1202 
A country relates its architecture to the reference in one of three ways, and the mapping records 1203 
which. Under adoption, the national architecture uses the reference elements directly, without 1204 
modification — the strongest form of alignment, and the most straightforward to assess. Under 1205 
adaptation, it modifies or extends reference elements to suit local context, health system 1206 
structure, or regulatory requirements — the most common path — and assessment then turns 1207 
on whether those modifications are explicitly documented and the rationale for deviation is clear. 1208 
Under mapping, a country that already has an established architecture keeps its own 1209 
terminology and structure and provides an explicit correspondence to the reference elements, 1210 
with assessment focused on the completeness and correctness of that correspondence. In each 1211 
   
 
86 
case the correspondence is expressed as a realisation relationship, and it is this that makes 1212 
adoption measurable. 1213 
 1214 
Coverage and gaps then fall out mechanically: 1215 
• A reference element is covered when at least one country element realises it. The 1216 
country architecture inherits that element's criteria — the Requirements, Constraints, 1217 
and conformance expectations attached to it — which are then tested as in 1218 
Conformance at the Application Component level. 1219 
• A single country system may realise several reference components; it covers all of them 1220 
and is subject to each one's criteria. 1221 
• A reference element that no country element realises is treated as absent — a gap, 1222 
surfaced exactly as under Planning testing from the architecture. 1223 
 1224 
Adoption is thereby quantifiable: coverage is the proportion of reference elements realised by 1225 
the country architecture, while the conformance of those covered elements is tested through 1226 
their inherited criteria. This holds whether the country adopts the reference elements directly, 1227 
adapts them (realisation with documented modification), or maps its own elements onto them. 1228 
Realisation is the strongest mapping — it asserts that the country element fulfils the reference 1229 
element's intent and so inherits its criteria; looser correspondences may use an Association or 1230 
Specialisation, but only realisation carries that inheritance. 1231
