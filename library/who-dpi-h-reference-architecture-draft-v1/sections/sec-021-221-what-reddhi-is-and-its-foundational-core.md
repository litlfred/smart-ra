Most countries embarking on digital health transformation do not start from a blank slate. They 102 
inherit vertical, often disease-specific programme systems, donor-funded tools, and legacy 103 
platforms, each designed to serve a specific function without reference to what else exists. Data 104 
is captured repeatedly across systems that cannot communicate, people and facilities are 105 
   
 
27 
identified differently in each, and lists are rarely reconciled. The consequence is a fragmented 106 
ecosystem that burdens health workers, weakens the quality, trust, and security of the data 107 
available for use, and makes every new investment less productive than it should be. 108 
REDDHI — Resilient Essential Data and Digital Health Infrastructure — describes the direction 109 
of travel that addresses this fragmentation: a governed, interoperable digital health 110 
infrastructure built on open standards and trusted, secure, quality data, within which local and 111 
regional innovation can flourish, investments can be mobilised and absorbed at scale, and the 112 
health system can sustain itself technically and financially over time. It is not a fixed destination 113 
to be reached and signed off, and it is not a set of systems to procure. It is a condition of self-114 
sustaining national digital health maturity that continues to evolve as needs and technology 115 
change — one in which the foundational capabilities every health programme depends upon are 116 
shared, interoperable, and governed in the public interest rather than duplicated in silos. 117 
A country does not need the whole of REDDHI in place to begin. The starting point can be a 118 
core set of metadata registries, the (lifelong) health record, and the means to exchange data 119 
between them; These registries are interdependent: a longitudinal record carries little weight 120 
without the means to establish where and by whom each entry was made, so the facility and 121 
health workforce registries are what allow the provenance of records to be established, just as 122 
the client registry is what allows them to be reliably attributed to the right individual. REDDHI is 123 
the broader, maturing state those foundations make possible. Countries do not become 124 
“REDDHI-compliant” at a point in time; rather, they can gauge progress through observable 125 
markers — whether authoritative registries exist and are reused across programmes, whether 126 
data is exchanged through governed, standards-based means, and whether the quality and 127 
stewardship of that data are actively managed. Framed this way, REDDHI gives countries a way 128 
to assess their current state, identify gaps, and ground architectural choices in health-system 129 
requirements rather than in whatever technology happens to be available. 130 
This interdependence is what defines the essential core: the capabilities whose absence 131 
imposes the greatest cost on the rest of the ecosystem, and which, once in place, make every 132 
other investment more connectable and more sustainable. The table below summarises these 133 
foundational capabilities and the DPI-H components that deliver them. Most of these capabilities 134 
form the minimum viable foundation that countries should prioritise regardless of starting point; 135 
other capabilities such as having consistent data structures across systems are typically built up 136 
from that foundation as maturity grows. The full mapping of capabilities to components across 137 
all seven priority health goals is set out in the methodology section that follows and the defining 138 
characteristics of DPI-H application components are described in the DPI-H application 139 
components sub-chapter. 140
