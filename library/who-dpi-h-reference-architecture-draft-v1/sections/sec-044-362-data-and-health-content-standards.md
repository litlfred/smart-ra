792 
Moving data reliably is necessary but not sufficient; the data also needs to carry its meaning 793 
intact. Two complementary concerns determine whether it does: the structure of the data — 794 
how clinical facts are organised, qualified and related to one another — and the meaning of the 795 
coded values that the structure contains. A single code for "blood pressure", for example, 796 
conveys little without the structure that situates it: systolic and diastolic components, the body 797 
site, and the patient's state at the time of measurement. Structure without governed meaning, 798 
and meaning without governed structure, each leave data that a receiving system is unable to 799 
interpret reliably. 800 
 801 
The architecture locates these two concerns in two foundational DPI-H components described 802 
elsewhere in this guidance. The Terminology Service governs meaning: the codes, value sets 803 
and classifications — drawn from, and mapped across, international vocabularies — by which 804 
clinical and administrative concepts are represented and interpreted consistently. The Logical 805 
Information Model Repository governs structure: the logical information models that define how 806 
data is organised and contextualised, maintained as governed, versioned national assets. The 807 
two are often summarised by analogy as the dictionary and the grammar of health data; both 808 
are required for data to be exchanged with its meaning preserved. 809 
 810

Health content standards supply the shared vocabulary and structure on which this depends. 811 
The architecture references, rather than reinvents, established and openly governed standards 812 
— among them HL7 FHIR for the exchange-oriented representation of health data; SNOMED 813 
CT (and SNOMED GPS), ICD-11 and LOINC for clinical terminology and classification; GS1 814 
and IDMP-family identifiers for products; DICOM for imaging; integration profiles such as those 815 
maintained by IHE; and content specifications such as the international patient summary, which 816 
defines the meaningful minimum that a given exchange should carry. The selection and binding 817 
of standards is made nationally and recorded in the information model and terminology 818 
components, so that systems implement a common national specification rather than divergent 819 
local interpretations. 820 
 821 
A widely used exchange standard does not by itself guarantee semantic interoperability. 822 
Standards designed primarily for data in motion are highly extensible, and uncoordinated 823 
extension produces what are sometimes described as interoperable silos: systems that each 824 
conform to the same standard yet are unable to exchange meaning because they have 825 
extended it differently. A nationally governed information model constrains and harmonises 826 
these extensions, providing the anchor against which conformance can be defined and tested. 827 
The benefit holds whichever representational paradigm a country adopts; aligning information 828 
models at the outset improves interoperability regardless of the underlying exchange or 829 
persistence technology. 830 
 831 
Because existing components cannot all adopt a single representation at once, the architecture 832 
provides for adaptation at the boundary. Where a connecting component does not natively 833 
speak the agreed specification, an adapter translates between its local representation and the 834 
national standard. Following established practice, the consuming side should provide the 835 
adapter it requires; this keeps the number of translations manageable and avoids the 836 
unscalable situation in which every component maps to every other. Adapters should perform 837 
representational translation only and should not become a place where clinical meaning is 838 
silently altered. 839
