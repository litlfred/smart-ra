Business Services Layer  ·  Health Supply Chain 3

ARCHITECTURE 
PLACEMENT 
AND AN 
IMPORTANT 
GOVERNANCE 
NOTE 
The Supplier Registry sits in the business services layer of the DPI -H reference 
architecture, as a reusable component serving the health supply chain domain. It is 
domain-specific shared infrastructure that serves the multiple functional applications 
involved in supply chain operations. This positioning reflects both the domain -
specific nature of supplier identity and an important governance reality: supplier 
registries are typically not owned by Ministries of Health — they commonly sit within 
finance, pro curement, trade, or regulatory authorities and serve multiple sectors 
simultaneously. The health sector's need for a Supplier Registry is therefore a cross-
sectoral infrastructure requirement. Where a cross -sectoral supplier or vendor 
registry exists at foundational DPI level, the health sector should leverage it. Where 
none exists, a health-sector implementation in the business services layer may be 
necessary as a transitional measure, with a view to eventual stewardship transfer to 
the appropriate cross -sectoral authority. The Supplier Registry is architecturally 
distinct from the Supplier and Contracts Management System, which manages the 
operational relationships — tendering, contracting, performance monitoring, and 
dispute resolution — that the registry's identity data supports. 
 5 
1  WHAT IT IS 
 6 
The Supplier Registry is the authoritative master data source for identity, classification, and regulatory 7 
status of suppliers engaged in the health supply chain — including manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, 8 
third-party logistics providers, importers, donor organisations, and NGO supply partners. It maintains a 9 
standardised, uniquely identified record for each supplier, providing the common reference point against 10 
which procurement, order management, warehouse, transport, and contract management systems can 11 
consistently identify, verify, and classify the organisations from which health products are sourced and 12 
through which they are distributed. 13 
The Supplier Registry is a metadata component in the architectural sense: it holds identity data, not 14 
transactional data. It records who a supplier is, where they operate, what they are certified and licensed to 15 
do, and under what regulatory conditions they are authorised to supply health products. It does not record 16 
what a supplier has been contracted to supply, at what price, or with what performance history — those 17 
functions belong to the Supplier and Contracts Management System, which consumes the Supplier 18 
Registry as its reference source. 19 
The Supplier Registry should have governance, like other registries, and gives every system in the supply 20 
chain a single, consistent answer to the question 'who is this supplier?' Without it, every procurement 21 
system, logistics platform, and contract management tool maintains its own local supplier list — with 22 
different identifiers, different classifications, and different data quality standards — making cross-system 23 
analysis, supplier performance comparison, and end-to-end traceability difficult to achieve with confidence. 24 
 25 
2  WHY IT MATTERS FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES 
 26 
Reliable access to safe health products depends not only on what is ordered and how it is managed within 27 
the health system, but also on who supplies it and under what conditions. Procurement decisions, quality 28 
   
 
192 
assurance processes, regulatory compliance, and supply chain traceability all require a consistent, 29 
trustworthy reference for supplier identity. In most health systems, that reference does not exist as shared 30 
infrastructure: each system that transacts with suppliers maintains its own version of supplier information, 31 
and those versions accumulate differences over time. The same manufacturer may appear under three 32 
different names in three different systems, with different contact details, different registration statuses, and 33 
different records of which products they are authorised to supply. 34 
This fragmentation has direct supply chain consequences. Procurement systems cannot reliably verify that 35 
a supplier is currently licensed and certified before issuing a purchase order. Regulatory authorities cannot 36 
quickly identify all products from a specific manufacturer when a quality alert or recall is issued. Logistics 37 
systems cannot efficiently identify alternative suppliers when primary supply chains fail. Cold chain 38 
management systems cannot confirm whether a particular supplier meets the storage and handling 39 
standards required for temperature -sensitive products. In each case, the underlying cause is the same: 40 
absence of a shared, authoritative supplier identity layer. 41 
This fragmentation has direct supply chain consequences. Without a shared supplier identity layer: 42 
• Procurement systems may struggle to verify that a supplier is currently licensed and certified 43 
before issuing a purchase order 44 
• Regulatory authorities are likely to face difficulty quickly identifying all products from a specific 45 
manufacturer when a quality alert or recall is issued 46 
• Logistics systems may be unable to efficiently identify alternative suppliers when primary supply 47 
chains are disrupted 48 
• Cold chain management systems may lack the information needed to confirm whether a particular 49 
supplier meets the storage and handling standards required for temperature-sensitive products. 50 
A governed Supplier Registry makes the consistent, verified supplier identity available as a service to all 51 
supply chain systems, reducing duplication of supplier verification effort, improving the reliability of 52 
regulatory compliance checking, enabling more effective response to supply disruptions, and supporting 53 
end-to-end traceability by anchoring product and transaction records to verified supplier identities. It also 54 
enables better procurement decisions: when lead times, geographic constraints, and minimum order 55 
requirements are governed centrally rather than maintained in individual procurement systems, demand 56 
planning and supplier sourcing become more reliable and more equitable across the network. 57 
 58 
3  CORE ATTRIBUTES 
 59 
– Supplier identity and master data management. Creation, maintenance, and publication of 60 
authoritative identity records for all suppliers engaged in the health supply chain, covering all 61 
supplier types, with a unique, persistent, centrally assigned supplier identifier as the canonical 62 
cross-system reference key. 63 
– Supplier classification and type management. Classification of suppliers by their role in the 64 
supply chain — manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, logistics provider, importer, donor, NGO — 65 
using a nationally governed classification scheme that enables consistent segmentation across 66 
procurement, logistics, and traceability functions. 67 
– Registration, licence, and certification management. Storage and governance of regulatory 68 
licences, import and export permits, quality certifications, and item-specific product registrations 69 
held by each supplier, with expiry date tracking and lifecycle status management enabling 70 
proactive compliance verification at the point of procurement or onboarding. 71 
– Multi-identifier management and GLN cross-referencing. Maintenance of multiple identifiers 72 
per supplier — including the national business registration number, the canonical supplier 73 
identifier, and Global Location Numbers (GLNs) — and the mappings between them, enabling 74 
systems that use different identifier schemes to resolve to the same supplier record. 75 
   
 
193 
– Geographic scope and multi-level supplier management. Recording of the operational 76 
countries, regions, and administrative levels at which each supplier is authorised to operate and 77 
supply health products, supporting pre-qualification rules and geographic constraints that apply in 78 
different parts of the supply network. 79 
– Procurement performance attribute management. Maintenance of key procurement attributes 80 
— including minimum order size and typical lead times — as centrally governed data that 81 
forecasting, planning, and procurement systems can consume as a shared reference rather than 82 
maintaining independently. 83 
– Access-controlled governance workflow. Role-based access management for supplier record 84 
authoring, review, approval, and publication, with a defined governance process that includes 85 
supplier self-registration capability where appropriate, verification by authorised procurement or 86 
regulatory staff, and version-controlled publication. 87 
– Standards-based API and integration. Exposure of machine-readable APIs enabling consuming 88 
systems — including procurement, order management, warehouse, transport, and contract 89 
management platforms — to retrieve supplier identity data in a consistent and portable manner. 90 
 91 
4  HOW IT CONNECTS 
 92 
The Supplier Registry completes the three-pillar master data foundation for health supply chain operations 93 
alongside the Product Registry and the Health Facility Registry. Supply chain transactions — ordering, 94 
receiving, distributing, tracking — involve products moving between locations through suppliers; without 95 
authoritative master data for all three, supply chain transactions cannot be consistently attributed, 96 
aggregated, or traced. 97 
The Supplier and Contracts Management System is the Supplier Registry's primary operational peer. The 98 
registry provides the authoritative supplier identity data; the Contracts Management System manages the 99 
contractual relationships, performance monitoring, and dispute resolution that depend on that identity. 100 
Every supplier contract and every supplier performance record should reference the canonical supplier 101 
identifier from the registry. A supplier that appears in a contract management system without a 102 
corresponding record in the Supplier Registry represents a gap in data governance — analogous to a facility 103 
receiving supplies without a Health Facility Registry record or a patient being seen without a Client Registry 104 
identifier 105 
The Order Management System, Warehouse and Inventory Management System, Procurement System, 106 
Cold Chain Management System, and Transportation Management System all consume the Supplier 107 
Registry as a reference for associating transactions with verified supplier identities. When an order is 108 
placed, fulfilled, or received, the supplier identity recorded in the transaction should trace to a canonical 109 
Supplier Registry record. This cross -referencing is what makes end -to-end supply chain traceability 110 
structurally possible. 111 
The Product Registry is a complementary dependency: supplier records are enriched by their associations 112 
with specific products, and product traceability depends on knowing which supplier manufactured or 113 
distributed a given batch. The linkage between product -level registration data in the Product Registry and 114 
supplier registration data in the Supplier Registry is the foundation for product recall management and 115 
quality alert dissemination. 116 
The Supplier Registry also serves as a foundational data input for supply chain traceability. End -to-end 117 
traceability — tracking a health product from manufacturer through the distribution network to the point of 118 
dispensing — requires the supplier identity to be in place and governed: without a verified, consistently 119 
referenced supplier record, batch and serial tracking data cannot be reliably attributed to an authoritative 120 
source. Where a traceability capability is implemented or planned, the Supplier Registry provides the 121 
supplier identity anchor on which that capability depends. 122 
Beyond the health supply chain, the Supplier Registry is a potential shared resource with other government 123 
functions. Finance systems use supplier identity for payment and audit; customs and trade authorities use 124 
it for import and export compliance; regulatory bodies use it for market authorisation and quality assurance. 125 
   
 
194 
Where a cross -sectoral foundational supplier registry exists, the health sector should reference it rather 126 
than duplicating it. Where it does not, the health sector's Supplier Registry should be designed and 127 
governed with cross-sectoral reuse in mind from the outset. 128

GOVERNANCE 
Governance of the Supplier Registry follows the cross-cutting governance framework 
in Section 3.4 of the guidance document. Component-specific considerations include:  
(1) Cross -sectoral stewardship. The most important governance question for the 
Supplier Registry is who should own it. Supplier identity is not a health-sector-specific 
concern; a supplier that manufactures medicines may also supply other sectors, and 
their regulatory status, certifications, and legal identity are matters of national 
commerce and trade policy. Where a cross -sectoral supplier registry exists — in a 
finance ministry, trade authority, or central procurement agency — the health sector 
should establish a formal data sharing arrangement to consume that registry rather 
than building a parallel one. Where none exists, the health sector may need to stand 
up an interim Supplier Registry while advocating for the development of cross-sectoral 
shared infrastructure. Countries should document the stewardship intention explicitly 
rather than defaulting to health-sector ownership by inertia.  
(2) Regulatory authority coordination. Licence and certification data in the Supplier 
Registry must be kept current, and the authoritative sources for that data are 
regulatory authorities rather than health ministries. The governance framework should 
establish formal data sharing arrangements with the national regulatory authority, 
import and export licensing bodies, and quality assurance agencies, so that changes 
in supplier regulatory status are reflected in the registry promptly and without requiring 
manual reconciliation.  
(3) Supplier self -registration. Many effective supplier registries support self -
registration by suppliers as the primary onboarding mechanism, with verification and 
approval by authorised staff as the governance control. This model reduces the data 
entry b urden on registry administrators and gives suppliers ownership over the 
accuracy of their own records. Governance must define the data elements that may 
be self -submitted, those that require verification, and the process for resolving 
disputes between submitted and verified data.  
(4) Lead time and order data as governance commitments. Lead time and minimum 
order data held in the registry represent commitments that may conflict with actual 
supplier behaviour. These attributes should be reviewed periodically against actual 
performance data held in procurement and order management systems, and updated 
through a governed change management process rather than being treated as static 
master data.
