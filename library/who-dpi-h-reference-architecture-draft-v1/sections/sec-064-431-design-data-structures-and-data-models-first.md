The most consequential implementation decision a country makes is not which software to 257 
procure but what data to capture and how to structure it. Data models define the shape of 258 
information across the entire digital health ecosystem — what fields are recorded for a client, 259 
how a facility is described, what attributes constitute a health worker record, how a product is 260 
catalogued. These decisions propagate into every system that stores, exchanges, or uses that 261 
data. Getting them right at the outset — and governing them through the semantic governance 262 
infrastructure described elsewhere in this chapter — is essential to achieving semantic 263 
interoperability across the ecosystem. 264

Countries should define and standardise a minimum set of data models for each DPI-H 265 
component before implementation begins, regardless of the technology through which those 266 
components will be delivered. These minimum data models should specify the mandatory data 267 
elements that every implementation supports — the irreducible set of attributes without which a 268 
registry, record, or service could not function as shared infrastructure — while allowing national 269 
extensions that accommodate country-specific requirements without breaking interoperability 270 
with the core. The logical information model repository is the designated home for these 271 
national data models, and its governance processes are the mechanism through which they are 272 
maintained, versioned, and distributed. 273 
For the core registries, minimum data models should address at least the following: for the client 274 
registry, the minimum demographic and identity attributes required to uniquely identify a person 275 
across health system interactions; for the facility registry, the minimum attributes required to 276 
describe a health service delivery point, including its location, service capabilities, and 277 
operational status; for the health workforce registry, the minimum attributes required to describe 278 
a licensed health worker, including their credentials, specialisation, and deployment; and for the 279 
product registry, the minimum attributes required to describe a regulated health product, 280 
including its identity, classification, and regulatory status. For terminology services and the 281 
logical information model repository, minimum profiles should address the metadata 282 
requirements for versioning, validity periods, and content integrity described in the semantic 283 
governance infrastructure section. 284
