The metadata registries that form the foundation of DPI -H — the client, health facility, health 374 
workforce and product registries, the Terminology Service, and the Logical Information Model 375 
Repository — are only as reliable as the governance that maintains them. A Terminology Service 376 
can be deployed and operational, and a Logical Information Model Repository can hold a rich 377 
catalogue of national data structures, yet without sustained, structured governance over how 378 
these assets are created, versioned, reviewed, published and distributed, the infrastructure they 379 
provide becomes progressively unreliable. In real implementations , countries have encountered 380 
concepts deprecated without notice, version conflicts between systems, and national 381 
implementation guides drifting from the models they were derived from. The reference 382 
architecture introduces the Semantic Governance Infrastructure (SGI)  to address these 383 
failures: it is the cross -cutting capability that keeps the metadata registry components accurate, 384 
consistent and trustworthy, so that the semantic consistency they are intended to provide does 385 
not degrade as the health digital ecosystem grows. 386 
A governance capability, not a technical component 387 
Before describing how it works, it is important to be clear about what SGI is and is not. It is not a 388 
new software product or a centralised technical component, and it is not an information -389 
technology concern to be delegated to a systems team. It is a cross -cutting capability — 390 
predominantly a matter of institutions, roles and processes — through which a health system 391 
governs the meaning of its data. The stakeholders who submit change requests, review and 392 
approve content, maintain national extensions of global standards, and ensure that local clinical 393 
reality is reflected in nationally governed models are as essential to SGI as any software. 394 
Experience in comparable settings shows that governance often runs on tools that were not 395 
   
 
58 
purpose-built for it, and that the quality of the process depends far more on the clarity of roles, 396 
decision rights and workflows than on the sophistication of the technology. Countries should 397 
therefore invest first in the committees, roles, decision rights and community processes of 398 
governance, and only afterwards in tooling. 399 
SGI is distinct from runtime services 400 
This governance capability is distinct from the runtime services that operate alongside it. A 401 
Terminology Service deployed to support clinical data capture performs a runtime function — 402 
vocabulary lookups, validation of coded entries, and distribution of value sets to consuming 403 
systems. SGI operates at a different level: it determines what content those services hold, how it 404 
is reviewed and approved, when it is published, how change is managed, and how consuming 405 
systems are notified. The two are complementary and mutually necessary: runtime services 406 
without governance produce content that cannot be trusted, while governance without runtime 407 
services produces decisions that cannot be operationalised. This integrated, cross -registry 408 
governance layer is a new aspect that DPI-H introduces. Existing health information architecture 409 
specifications, including OpenHIE, specify the runtime terminology service but not the cross -410 
registry semantic -governance described here — the coordinated review workflows, multi -411 
stakeholder curation, release management and harmonisation flows between global, national and 412 
local content that span the Terminology Service, the Logical Information Model Repository and 413 
national data models together. SGI is therefore presented as cross -cutting rather than a 414 
component of any single registry, because its scope spans all of the metadata registry 415 
components and because its processes need to be coherent across them rather than managed 416 
independently for each. 417 
How SGI relates to runtime and content 418 
It is helpful to see this capability in relation to the services around it. Three layers can be 419 
distinguished. 420 
1. The governance layer comprises the policies, roles, decision rights and workflows through 421 
which registry content is managed across its lifecycle — how requests for new terms or model 422 
changes are submitted, how they are reviewed by the relevant stakeholders, how approved 423 
changes are packaged and published, and how the ongoing quality and currency of content is 424 
assessed.  425 
2. The runtime layer comprises the operational terminology servers, repository deployments and 426 
national data model infrastructure through which governed content is made available to 427 
consuming systems.  428 
3. The content and application  layer comprises the clinical systems, analytics platforms and 429 
applications that consume governed content and, in doing so, generate the feedback that informs 430 
the next governance cycle. 431

 436 
What SGI does: five capability categories 437 
Where the three layers describe where governance sits, the next question is what it does. Within 438 
the governance layer, five categories of capability recur across the metadata registry components. 439 
They are described here at the level of capability clusters; a fuller breakdown of the individual 440 
capabilities within each is provided in Appendix F, and the detailed specification of any one of 441 
them is a matter for dedicated standards efforts and national programmes rather than for this 442 
architecture. 443

Consumption 
Enabling downstream stakeholders to

Lowers the barrier for systems to 
align with national standards, 
accelerating interoperability across 
the ecosystem 
 445 
Two points qualify this model. First, monitoring should be understood as two related but separate 446 
activities: monitoring of the publication process  and content quality on the one hand, and 447 
monitoring of use and adoption in the field on the other; the two answer different questions and 448 
both are needed. Second, the definition and maintenance of policy is not confined to any one 449 
category — it cuts across all of them, and is the connective tissue that makes the capabilities 450 
function as a coherent whole rather than as isolated workflows.  451 
Approaches to implementation 452 
Countries need not achieve full semantic governance maturity before deploying metadata 453 
registries, and the appropriate starting point varies considerably by context. In highly regulated 454 
settings — where data structures may be encoded in legislation — a comprehensive governance 455 
framework may need to be established before deployment proceeds. In many lower -resource 456 
settings, deployment can and should precede full governance maturity, with governance 457 
capabilities built incrementally as the ecosystem develops. A maturity -spectrum approach is 458 
therefore appropriate, progressing from minimal reference -list management, through structured 459 
versioning and change workflows, to fully governed, multi -stakeholder terminology and 460 
information-model ecosystems. What matters from the outset is that early deployment decisions 461 
do not close off the path to stronger governance later, and that a clear direction of travel is 462 
established even where immediate capacity is limited. Established terminology -governance 463 
maturity models can be applied, with some abstraction, across the metadata registry components. 464

 468 
Global, national and local content 469 
SGI also mediates the relationship between global, national and local content. A maximalist global 470 
model imposed on countries without local adaptation mechanisms will not be adopted; equally, 471 
uncoordinated national models that cannot speak to one another reproduce the fragmentation the 472 
architecture seeks to resolve. The governance framework should therefore support both top-down 473 
harmonisation — keeping national models coherent with global standards — and upward sensing 474 
— capturing local experience, term requests and adaptation needs so they can inform models at 475 
higher levels. It should also help countries manage their interfaces with the standards 476 
development organisations on whose content they depend, including the lag that arises when an 477 
external standard updates and national implementations have to respond. Grounding national 478 
arrangements in established governance frameworks gives countries a tested starting point. 479 
Several exist to draw on, such as HL7's Unified Terminology Governance (UTG) process for 480 
consensus-based authoring and release of terminology artefacts, and SNOMED International's 481 
National Release Centre model, through which member countries govern their national editions 482 
of clinical terminology; the OpenHIE Architecture Specification is also relevant, though it specifies 483 
the runtime terminology service rather than the cross-registry governance. Each of these governs 484 
a single standard or service; what SGI adds is the coordination of such arrangements across 485 
registries at national level. 486

Countries implementing DPI-H should treat SGI not as an optional enhancement to their metadata 492 
registries but as foundational for those registries to deliver the semantic consistency that DPI -H 493 
depends upon. 494
