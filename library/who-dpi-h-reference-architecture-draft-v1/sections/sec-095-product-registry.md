Core Registries for Health  ·  DPI-H Foundational Layer  379 
 380 
ARCHITECTURE 
PLACEMENT 
The Product Registry is a foundational DPI -H component holding core product 
master data — standardised, and cross -sectorally reusable. It is architecturally 
distinct from the Product Catalogue Management tool, which extends the registry 
with richer, operat ionally enriched attributes specific to health supply chain use 
cases (pricing, substitution rules, clinical interactions, adverse event linkage, volume 
metrics, label & registration information). The distinction between a domain-specific 
product list and a foundational registry lies not in the data it holds but in its scope of 
reuse: the Product Registry earns its foundational status because the same product 
identity data is needed across health, social protection, customs, regulatory 
authorities, and any other government function that transacts in health commodities. 
Countries should implement the Product Registry first; the Product Catalogue 
Management Tool builds on it. 
 381 
1  WHAT IT IS 
 382 
The Product Registry is the national authoritative source of core identity and classification data for health 383 
products — medicines, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, and health commodities — recognised for 384 
use within the national health system. It maintains a standardised, uniquely identified, and governed record 385 
for each product, providing the common reference point against which all supply chain, clinical, and 386 
regulatory systems can consistently identify and classify what they are ordering, storing, dispensing, or 387 
reporting on. 388 
Unlike the Product Catalogue Management Tool, which extends the registry with pricing, clinical 389 
enrichment, and procurement-specific attributes, the Product Registry holds the stable core attributes that 390 
are needed across sectors and systems — the minimum sufficient set to unambiguously identify a product 391 
and support interoperability. It is a foundational DPI-H component: reusable not only across health supply 392 
chain systems but potentially across any government function that transacts in health commodities. 393 
Implementing a Product Registry is as much a data management process as it is a technical deployment. 394 
The WHO Digital Transformation Handbook for Health Product Catalogue (2025) frames this as a stepwise 395 
process: assessing the current state of product data, standardising data structures and identifiers, standing 396 
up the registry capability, and continuously governing data quality over time. Countries should approach 397 
the Product Registry as an ongoing programme of product master data management, not a one-time system 398 
implementation. The functional and data requirements in this articulation should be interpreted in that 399 
context — some attributes are prerequisites for the first usable version; others represent the target state of 400 
a mature, well-governed implementation. 401 
 402 
2  WHY IT MATTERS FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES 
 403 
Without a shared, authoritative product identity layer, it becomes significantly harder for systems to reliably 404 
order, track, or dispense medicines and health commodities, as each facility, warehouse, and ordering 405 
system tends to maintain its own local product list. The same medicine appears under different codes, 406 
descriptions, and unit definitions in different systems — making it difficult to consolidate demand, track 407 
   
 
146 
stock across tiers, detect diversions, or produce credible national consumption data 53. This fragmentation 408 
weakens the reliability of supply chain data at every level as forecasting is based on inconsistent product 409 
definitions, demand cannot be cleanly aggregated across systems, and shortage signals emerge later and 410 
less clearly than they should — reducing the time available to respond before service delivery is affected. 411 
When a Product Registry is in place, systems that participate in the health supply chain draw from the same 412 
product master. For example, forecasting systems can aggregate demand across facilities using consistent 413 
identifiers, and warehouse systems across different tiers of the supply chain can match incoming deliveries 414 
to orders without manual reconciliation, even when the delivering party and receiving system use different 415 
internal identifiers — because both resolve to the same canonical product record. These enabling 416 
conditions for a supply chain that reliably gets the right product to the right place in the right condition, also 417 
produce efficiency gains. 418 
 419 
3  CORE ATTRIBUTES 
 420 
– Product identity and master data management. Creation, maintenance, and publication of 421 
authoritative product records, covering the standardised core attributes that uniquely identify each 422 
product at both generic and item (brand/pack) level. 423 
– Identifier management and cross-referencing. Management of multiple identifier schemes — 424 
including global trade identifiers (GTINs) and national product codes — and the mappings between 425 
them, enabling systems that use different identifiers to resolve to the same product. 426 
– Multi-scheme product classification. Classification of products under applicable international 427 
and national coding schemes (e.g., UNSPSC for pharmaceuticals, GPC for medical devices, ATC 428 
for medicines), supporting simultaneous classification under multiple schemes where required. 429 
– Packaging hierarchy and unit of measure management. Definition and maintenance of the 430 
packaging levels for each product (unit, inner pack, case, pallet) with the associated GTINs and 431 
quantity conversions across levels, enabling consistent unit-of-measure handling across ordering, 432 
warehousing, and dispensing. 433 
– Generic-to-item mapping. Management of the relationship between a generic product definition 434 
(e.g., amoxicillin 500mg capsule) and the specific branded items that fulfil it, supporting therapeutic 435 
substitution, equivalence determination, and brand-agnostic procurement. 436 
– Product lifecycle and change management. Maintenance of full version history for product 437 
records, including capture of all changes with timestamps and author attribution, and support for 438 
defined lifecycle states (draft, active, deprecated, retired). 439 
– Access-controlled governance workflow. Role-based access management for product record 440 
authoring, review, approval, and publication, supporting the governance processes required to 441 
maintain master data quality and integrity. 442 
– Bulk data onboarding and external source integration. Capability to receive product data from 443 
external authoritative sources — including manufacturers, the Global Data Synchronisation 444 
Network (GDSN), and regulatory bodies — via both bulk upload and system-to-system integration. 445 
 446 
4  HOW IT CONNECTS 
 447 
The Product Registry is one of the Core Registries for Health within the DPI -H reference architecture. Its 448 
closest structural counterpart is the Product Catalogue Management Tool, which extends the registry with 449 
health-specific operational attributes — dosage guidance, substitution rules, adverse event linkage, 450 
procurement pricing, and clinical interaction data — that are too domain-specific and dynamically changing 451 
to belong in the foundational registry layer. The Product Catalogue Management Tool consumes the 452 
 
53 USAID GHSC-PSM Product Master Data Management Reference Guide (2020) 
https://www.ghsupplychain.org/sites/default/files/2021-11/2021_GHSC-PSM%20PMDM%20Reference%20Guide_Final.pdf  
   
 
147 
Product Registry as its master source: all items in the catalogue it produces should trace to a registry record, 453 
and the registry's identifiers are the canonical keys used throughout the supply chain. 454 
Within the supply chain domain, the Product Registry is consumed by every operational system – 455 
forecasting and planning systems use product identifiers to aggregate demand signals; order management 456 
and warehouse systems use GTINs and packaging hierarchy data to match orders to receipts and manage 457 
stock; procurement and supplier contract systems reference product identifiers when creating and 458 
evaluating tenders; cold chain and transportation systems apply storage requirements and volumetric data 459 
held in the registry to plan and monitor product movement; and dispensing systems use generic -to-item 460 
mappings to confirm brand equivalence. 461 
The Product Registry depends on the Terminology Service for the standardised codes used in classification 462 
(ATC, UNSPSC, GPC) and for the controlled vocabularies governing dosage form, route of administration, 463 
and unit of measure. The Logical Information Model Repository would hold the structural model defining 464 
which data elements the registry should capture, their cardinalities, and their terminology bindings. The 465 
Product Registry is also the foundational anchor for batch and serial traceability, as any system that tracks 466 
individual product batches, lot numbers, or serialised units requires a canonical product master record to 467 
give those tracking identifiers meaning. This relationship is described in both the GS1 Standards in the 468 
Medicines Supply Chain Implementation Guidance and the Center for Global Development's work on 469 
improving global health supply chains through traceability, both of which position product master data 470 
management as the prerequisite capability for any traceability programme54,55. The Health Facility Registry 471 
and Supplier Registry are co-dependencies in the supply chain domain — together, they provide the three 472 
master data pillars (product, location, supplier) on which all supply chain transactions depend. 473

GOVERNANCE 
Governance of the Product Registry follows the cross-cutting governance framework 
set out in Section 3.4 of the guidance document. Component-specific considerations 
include:  
(1) The Product Registry steward should maintain relationships with the relevant 
national regulatory authority to ensure that product approval status is reflected in 
registry records in a timely manner.  
(2) Where a national GDSN data pool exists or a manufacturer data synchronisation 
arrangement is in place, the governance framework should specify how authoritative 
data from those sources is incorporated, and which takes precedence in cases of 
conflict.  
(3) Lifecycle management for product records should be coordinated with the Product 
Catalogue steward, since deprecation of a registry record affects all catalogue entries 
that extend it.

 493 
A Comparative View of the Product Registry and the Product Catalogue Management Tool 494 
 495 
The Product Registry and the Product Catalogue Management Tool address different problems in the 496 
product data landscape. The registry provides the stable, cross -sectoral identity layer — the minimum 497 
sufficient description of what a product is. The Product Catalogue Management Tool provides the enriched, 498 
operationally specific information that health system actors need to use, procure, and prescribe products 499 
appropriately. Both are necessary; neither is a substitute for the other. 500

The 
fundamental 
problem each 
component 
exists to solve 
across any system that orders, stores, 
dispenses, or reports on it? 
Example: "Is this item amoxicillin 500mg 
capsule (ATC J01CA04), manufactured 
by Company X, with GTIN 
12345678901234?" 
Tool provides the workflows, processes, 
and operational capabilities through 
which a product catalogue — the 
enriched, health -specific output — is 
produced and kept current. 
 
What it holds 
The specific 
attributes 
managed by 
each 
component 
Core identity attributes: product 
identifiers (GTIN, UDI, national codes), 
generic product description, brand name, 
manufacturer name, 
ATC/UNSPSC/GPC/WHODrug/IDMP 
classification, dosage form, strength, 
route of administration, packaging 
hierarchy, storage requirements, 
volumetrics, shelf life, generic -to-item 
mapping, and regulatory registration 
details. 
The PCMT produces a product catalogue 
as its output. That catalogue holds 
operationally enriched attributes: 
formulary status and listing category, 
clinical indications and approved uses, 
therapeutic substitution rules, drug -drug 
interaction data, adverse drug reaction 
profiles, pricing and contract terms, 
minimum order quantities, preferred and 
alternative supplier information, and 
programme-specific configurations. The 
PCMT provides the workflows, approval 
processes, and governance mechanisms 
through whic h those attributes are 
created, validated, and kept current. 
Data stability 
How 
frequently 
attributes 
change and 
why 
Stable. Core identity attributes change 
infrequently — typically on product 
launch, regulatory reclassification, 
packaging revision, or manufacturer 
change. The registry is designed for 
master data that is authoritative and slow-
moving. 
Dynamic. Operational attributes change 
regularly — prices are renegotiated 
seasonally or per procurement cycle, 
formulary decisions change with policy 
reviews, clinical guidance is updated with 
evidence. The catalogue is designed to 
accommodate this cadence. 
Number of 
instances in 
a country 
How many of 
each a 
country 
typically has 
One per country. The Product Registry is 
a single national authoritative source. 
Multiple instances or fragmented national 
registries create the same identification 
problems the registry exists to solve. 
Potentially multiple. A country may have 
separate management tools serving 
different operational contexts — a 
national formulary management tool, a 
procurement catalogue management 
system, a hospital -level medicines 
management application — each 
producing its own catalogue output. All 
should reference the single Product 
Registry as their canonical product 
identity source, ensuring that the different 
catalogues they produce can be 
reconciled against a common product 
master.

management tool enriches and extends 
registry data, it does not replace or 
duplicate it. 
Governance 
Who stewards 
each 
component 
and under 
what authority 
Single national steward — typically the 
national regulatory authority, Ministry of 
Health, or a designated product data 
agency. Governance is cross -sectoral 
because the registry is used beyond 
health. Change management is 
conservative: updates require form al 
approval and version control. 
May have multiple stewards, each with 
authority over different aspects of the 
enriched product information the tool 
manages: a national formulary committee 
for clinical listing decisions, a 
procurement authority for pricing and 
contract data, clinical advisory bodies for 
therapeutic guidance. The tool's 
governance framework should 
accommodate this multi -stakeholder 
model, with change processes that are 
more frequent and more decentralised 
than those governing the registry 
Relationship 
to each other 
How the two 
components 
depend on 
and interact 
with one 
another 
The Product Registry is the master 
source for all product identity data. The 
Product Catalogue Management Tool 
consumes registry records as its 
foundational anchor — every catalogue 
entry should reference a registry record 
by its canonical identifier. When a registry 
record is deprecated or retired, the 
Product Catalogue Management Tool 
should review and update all dependent 
catalogue entries accordingly. 
The Product Catalogue Management 
Tool is always downstream of the Product 
Registry. It references registry records by 
canonical identifier rather than replicating 
their data and enriches them with health-
specific operational attributes to produce 
the catal ogue. A product cannot be 
published in any catalogue the tool 
manages before a corresponding record 
exists in the Product Registry. 
Primary 
users 
The roles and 
systems that 
interact 
directly with 
each 
component 
Supply chain planners, procurement 
officers, warehouse and inventory 
management systems, order 
management systems, dispensing 
systems, cold chain systems, regulatory 
authorities, and any cross -sectoral 
system that needs to identify a health 
commodity. 
Prescribers, pharmacists, formulary 
managers, clinical decision support 
systems, procurement and tender 
management systems, health insurance 
claims adjudication systems, and health 
technology assessment bodies. 
Risk if 
absent 
The specific 
failure that 
results if each 
component is 
not in place 
Every system maintains its own product 
list with its own identifiers and 
classifications. The same product 
appears under different codes in different 
systems, making cross -system 
aggregation unreliable, duplicate orders 
undetectable, and national consumpti on 
data untrustworthy. 
Clinical and procurement systems rely on 
manual, fragmented, or non -
standardised processes to access 
enriched product information. Pricing and 
supplier data exist only in dispersed 
contract documents rather than a 
structured, queryable repository. 
Formulary guidance and therapeutic 
substitution rules are harder to maintain 
consistently across facilities, increasing 
the risk of variation in prescribing practice 
and procurement decisions at scale.

Note: This table reflects a three-level distinction. A product catalogue is the structured collection and 503 
presentation of enriched product information and attributes. The Product Catalogue Management Tool is 504 
the system that provides the functions, workflows, and operational processes used to create, validate, 505 
maintain, govern, and publish that information — the catalogue is its output. The Product Registry is 506 
broader and more foundational: it serves as the authoritative reference source for uniquely identifying and 507 
maintaining core product information across systems, supporting interoperability, governance, and 508 
linkage across health and non-health sectors. The Product Catalogue Management Tool is not described 509 
in detail in this articulation; its full component description is a separate document. The table above is 510 
intended to establish the architectural boundary between the registry and the management tool so that 511 
each can be designed, procured, and governed without conflation. 512
