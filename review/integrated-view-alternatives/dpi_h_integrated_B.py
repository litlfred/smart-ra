"""DPI-H RA "Integrated View" (draft v1 Figs. 3.2 and 3.5) as ArchiMate views.

Source: WHO/ITU Reference Architecture and Guidance for DPI-H, review draft v1
(library/who-dpi-h-reference-architecture-draft-v1): Figure 3.2 (PDF 59, the
full poster) and Figure 3.5 (PDF 77, the DPI-H layers only).

One element per box of the figure. Boxes the model already has are reused
(EXISTING). Where an existing element may be the same thing under another name,
the new element carries `candidateMatch` naming it, for the owner to decide, as
in dth_sc.py (Q-IV-2). REDDHI components carry `reddhi=true`. Layer and domain
membership is Aggregation from a Grouping; no other relationship is added,
because the figure draws none.
